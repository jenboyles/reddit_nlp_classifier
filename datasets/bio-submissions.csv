I have a Bachelors in Biology and am currently working as a test technician in the automotive field (Materials Testing). I am 30 and not planning on having kids. I'm looking for the next step to take to further my career.  I would like to go back to school for a Masters degree but i am unsure of what my options are or what I want to do next.

My job offers tuition reimbursement if the schooling you are getting is related to the field. But then they also own your ass for the next 5 years or so.

biology,"So been dealing with insane fatigue since February 2019. Tried everything. Doc first thought it's an iron deficiency although tests were inconclusive. Supplements didn't work for some reason. I tried infusion out of curiosity 2 weeks ago for the first time. I got 350mg over the course of 1 week.

After that my anxiety disappeared, hair improved, fatigue improved.

Yesterday I began the 2nd session. I got 120mg of iron infusion. In the evening I tried exercise. I noticed right away that my ability to tolerate exercise increased quite a bit. I wasnt breathing heavily. Also supplements like Iodine which I took yesterday evening didnt make me fatigued either whereas before iodine would make me super exhausted.

I am very surprised this is helping me and although blood work was inconclusive me and my doc think we are on the right track. The symptoms are improving and I simply feel better for the first time in nearly 2 years.

I still have some fatigue and hope the symptoms will go away completely soon.

The fatigued and further deterioration in my health started when I started throwing away blood. I remember donating 400 ml of blood in 2019 and 500ml of blood in 2020.

biology,"Polio, smallpox, hepatitis A and B are all serious viruses humanity learned to subdue with effective solutions. Even the flu, which can shift and mutate each year, has a vaccine. And yet, there’s no remedy for the lowly cold. 

The hunt for a cure for the common cold began in the 1950s, shortly after scientists discovered the primary group of pathogens—known as rhinoviruses—behind the sniffles. Together it accounts for up to 75 percent of colds in adults. 

There’s at least 160 different strains, or serotypes, of Rhinovirus.  “It’s incredibly difficult to create a vaccine or drug that will target all of those 160 \[strains\],” Barlow says. 

“Even if we find a cure for the cold, it probably won’t be made available to healthy people who shrug the cold off in three to four days.” A cure might not even be that useful, because most people are already recovering by the time they’re able to see a doctor. 

While we can treat the symptoms of a cold, we cannot find a single cure as there are so many types of virus and they mutate rapidly. Therefore, in the time it takes to develop a vaccine, it is no longer useful.

biology,"I heard that we can potentially use embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells(IPSCs) to create gametes even from infertile people. However, I'm a bit skeptical of this because some articles have claimed that this technology will allow us to make sperm cells from anyone's skin cells including a woman's and egg cells vice versa with a man's.

The thing is I know that some of the genes necessary for sperm proliferation are located only on the Y chromosome with a few others on the autosomes. So I don't really know if this technique would work in making sperm cells from a woman's cell or genome.

In regards to making egg cells out of a man's cell or genome is this possible as well? I would say so since both men and women share everything except for the Y and that would mean that genes necessary for egg cell production are shared between both sexes. This could be hindered however by the fact egg cell production could require 2 X chromosomes to carry out in which case it won't be possible to create egg cells from men. Not to mention that egg cells are already vastly more complex than your typical sperm so this something we can achieve with current technology now or sometime in the future?

biology,"My teacher told us to go out into nature‚ and take a photograph with e.g. a mobile camera. My task is to explain with the help of this picture how the concepts of cellular respiration, photosynthesis, and organic compounds, map onto each other. Using the picture, I am supposed to also explain the carbon cycle. Here is the [picture ](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/698789712386588682/775735800146427904/unknown.png) I took. Below, you will find what I answered on this essay, and would appreciate if you could review it (no need on the grammar).

&gt; I know that the processes of photosynthesis, and cellular respiration, recycle a common set of chemicals: water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and organic compounds such as glucose. But here, we don't see any glucose, because I take it to be something edible, and leaves in this picture is not edible. Further, the water in this picture is evaporating, leading to water going from one form to another, i.e. from liquid to gas. 

&gt; Glucose and other energy-rich substances that living things depend on, are derived from plants (and cyanobacteria). The plants have a unique ability to produce an organic substance from inorganic substances. Namely, they form glucose from carbon dioxide and water. It is the carbon dioxide that contributes the carbon atoms to the chain of carbon atoms that form the ""backbone"" or base of any organic molecule, in this instance, the glucose molecules. 

&gt; In addition to carbon dioxide and water, energy is required to produce glucose, which is ""charged"" with energy. The plants solve this by converting light energy from the sun, and with the help of the green substance chlorophyll, light energy is collected inside the plant. Since light is used as an energy source, the plants' production of glucose is called photosynthesis (photo = light, synthesis = composition).

&gt; In addition to glucose, oxygen is formed during photosynthesis. The oxygen gas is formed because the reactants carbon dioxide and water contain more oxygen atoms than are required for glucose production. The plants emit oxygen to the environment. Basically, photosynthesis can be described as such: 

&gt; light energy + carbon dioxide + water → glucose + oxygen 

&gt; In order for the carbon and hydrogen atoms to be sufficient for one glucose molecule, six carbon dioxide, and six water molecules, are required. These contain an excess of oxygen atoms, and therefore, six oxygen molecules are also formed.

&gt; Most people living on this planet are dependent on plants because they need oxygen for cellular respiration. The oxygen present in the atmosphere has been formed by photosynthesis. Plants also need oxygen. It is easy to understand why animals and humans need cellular respiration.

&gt; For plants, light energy can not be saved or transported in a plant. Energy-rich molecules, on the other hand, can be saved and transported. Because the plants' cells use glucose as fuel, they can also get energy at night when it is dark. In addition, glucose can be transported to the cells of the roots, which also need energy. 

&gt; Since plants also have cellular respiration, they are also dependent on the formation of oxygen during photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water are used up while glucose and oxygen are formed. During cellular respiration, the opposite happens. Glucose reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, and water. In this way, the constituent substances participate in a cycle and do not end up on Earth. Photosynthesis is powered by light energy.

&gt; During cellular respiration, the corresponding amount of energy is released. This is finally converted into heat that radiates from the organisms. Over time, the heat also radiates from the atmosphere and further into space. This means that the energy cannot be reused in a cycle. It flows through the system and therefore life on earth is constantly dependent on new energy from the sun.

&gt; During photosynthesis, light energy is converted into chemically-bound energy into glucose. Through cellular respiration and other processes, chemically-bound energy is finally converted into heat that leaves the Earth. Therefore, new energy from the sun is always needed. Substances, on the other hand, can be included in cycles and do not have to run out.","Need someone to review this essay on Cellular Respiration, and Photosynthesis, based on the picture I took"

[SARS vaccines prototypes with alum as adjuvant triggered antibody-dependent enhancement of SARS, rather than protecting against it.](https://jvi.asm.org/content/85/23/12201) I suppose that's likely to be the case with SARS-cov-2 as well, if a similar vaccine with the same adjuvant was used. It has been observed to trigger predominantly Th2 cell response, [which happens to be the situation also found on severe covid-19 cases.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7205481/)

Could it be then that people who recently took a vaccine for something else, that also used alum as adjuvant, are at higher risk of severe covid if they're infected?

Hi, I am a foreigner living in Japan for almost 6 years. I came as an undergraduate under mext program to pursue my bachelor's degree in Life Science. I had zero wet lab experience before joining the Ph.D. program (in Japan). For the past 8 months, I had the most depressing time of my life. The experiment never worked, labmates were getting pissed up with me. PI who once liked me seemed disappointed taking me in. 

So, with all the good reason, I left the lab. I almost slept in the lab and worked hard but even basic experiments like cloning and cell culture were very hard for me.

On paper I look fairly okay, the bio startup after rounds of interview decided to give me a position. As I mentioned above, I am a foreigner I need some decent amount to survive here. I contacted a few bioinformatics professors, but most of them had very limited funding.

I'm scared to join the startup as I might screw things up, on other hand I need money to survive.   
I wish to transition towards the dry lab, but I have very limited computational skills.

biology,"First off, in transformation the donor DNA aligns itself with the complementary bases in the recipient DNA.

Now a ""perfect"" alignment of the donor DNA ( Sorry if my terminologies are incorrect ) would mean that an exact replica of the donor DNA fragment already exists in the recipient DNA. If such is the case no genetic recombination will take place but genetic recombination is observed, this is the part where I get confused.

If the DNA fragment is aligning itself with the donor DNA and and causing a genetic recombination,then obviously the donor DNA fragment should contain some variation from the recipient's DNA. This would mean that the alignment of the DNA fragment isn't perfect and not every base in DNA fragment can form a complementary base pairs with the recipient DNA. ( Again sorry for usage of improper terminology as im a new student who just started an introductory course pertaining to microbiology ).

Now the problem is -

1)Shouldn't it be energetically unfavorable for the donor DNA fragment to replace the original DNA as the original one should be able to form complementary base pairs with the entirety of the recipient DNA while the donor DNA can do so only with a part of the recipient DNA.

After thinking about this, I thought of an assumption to explain this. The RecA protein involved in transformation is somehow forcing this process to happen. The thing is how? I have zero knowledge of enzyme chemistry and can't understand how this could possibly happen? So is this assumption correct? If so is there any reference material explaining how RecA protein could be doing this?

The textbook I have does say that RecA protein is catalysing this, but simply saying RecA is doing this doesn't adequately explain it.

2)This brings me to the second issue. This newly created DNA should now have many irregularities, how are they fixed?

After some thinking, I came to the conclusion that as RecA proteins are involved in DNA repair, the RecA protein simply fixes the irregularities. Is this line of thinking correct?

In short, I have assumed that a RecA protein is causing a DNA fragment which can not form complementary base pairs with the entirety of recipient DNA to be accepted in the recipient DNA, following which the irregularities that arise are also fixed by RecA. Is this line of thinking correct?

Obviously making assumptions in biology is wrong but that's all I can do at the moment.

the pages for Sauropsids and Synapsids contradicts this, with Sauropsids including (proto/)Reptiles and Birds (as it should be) and Synapsids as (proto/)Mammals

The first definition would imply that there is a common ancestor to both reptiles and Mammals that is defined as a Reptile itself, making the exclusion of mammals notable. However, the distinction between Synapsids and Sauropsids contradicts this, as they encapsulate proto-reptiles and proto-mammals, which as they coexist alongside eachother would make reptiles predating Mammals, especially as to the ancestor of all Mammals being a Reptile

biology,"All matter conveys information, but life is unique in that it can also subjectively interpret and manipulate information in a meaningful way. Consider information as what can be described from matter, such as its composition or temperature. One way to see it would be that the better an organism 'understands' its environment, that is, the more information it can use to its advantage, then the better are its chances of survival. When an animal smells food, it knows it is food (with varying specificity), either innately or because it remembers how certain foods smell like. The better this sense and the more an individual can identify things with it, then the more useful it becomes. Thus, this trait will be selected for and conserved in offspring if the genes involved directly increase their reproductive fitness. 

Thermodynamically speaking, information allows life to convert available energy into useful work in ways which minimise the consequent increase in entropy. For example, the lac operon in E. coli is activated when there is lactose, but no available glucose to extract its free energy through oxidation. That genetic programme allows for a quick predetermined response, minimising the system's gain in entropy compared to say, transcribing random genes with the hopes something will eventually metabolise lactose. This represents bit of paradox however, if information minimises a system's increase in entropy (produced from the work by which it is sustained), then how come organismal complexity has exponentially increased over the past 600 million years? When we look at the human evolutionary tree, this trend reflects on our history as well, as all of modernity practically occurred within a geological instant.

While life selects for efficiency and adaptability, this does not necessarily imply change. In fact, many forms of life have seen very little of it, even over billions of years. Prokaryotes, for example, are the most conserved and bioenergetically efficient domain of life and will likely not change much, ever. Eukaryotes, on the other hand, can be so complex that some have even managed to leave the planet that spawned them. Yet, I'd argue that this complexity is a consequence of their biggest flaw; eukaryotic cells are so thermodynamically inefficient that mitochondria must produce massive amounts of excess energy to sustain their internal processes. This generates a lot of entropy, which must be diverted before it otherwise denatures the cell. If we consider DNA as a possible target, then we could say that evolution is a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics, since the entropy of a system will always increase if it is producing energy or converting it into work. This would explain why genetic complexity is irreversible, even if taxa can revert to anatomically primitive states (e.g. Trichoplax adhaerens), they will still retain those traits that define their ancestry, such as Integrins in the case of Metazoa.

I believe the same logic also illustrates the issue with Maxwell's demon\*. Without going into much detail, the flaw in this thought experiment is that it implies that information is energetically 'free', but it is not; interpreting, storing, and manipulating information requires energy, and that will always generate entropy. Moreover, if the number of tasks an organism can do depends on the amount of information it can use, then this will also correlate to the amount of energy required to achieve such work. 

With that in mind, perhaps multicellularity and all it entails was an inevitable consequence of the universe's desire to self-destruct (i.e. the second law). To illustrate, a single-celled embryo represents the lowest possible entropy of a multicellular organism, but totipotency encodes too much information to be restrained to a single cell, ultimately driving morphogenesis and development

*\*:  Maxwell's Demon describes how a theoretical, all-knowing organism could reduce the entropy of a system by predicting when gas molecules in a chamber will bounce off a gate separating them from another chamber under vacuum. The reasoning behind this is that the demon can move every single molecule into the next chamber (and thus appear to violate the 2nd law of thermodynamics) without expending energy, simply by knowing when molecules approach. AFAIK Maxwell's demon has been proved impossible, as the mere act of opening the gate requires energy.*

biology,"*Among Charles Darwin’s stories, one of the most familiar is about the finches (little songbirds) that he saw in the Galapagos Islands. After colonizing the islands, a single pioneering species had diversified into several. Is SARS-CoV-2, having recently colonized the human body, diversifying into novel strains responsible for the waves of infection that are now occurring? After all, the human body, like Earth’s environments, presents many varied microhabitats.* 

After submarine volcanos spewed enough lava to rise above the sea surface, colonization began on the naked, new islands. As the Galapagos Islands are located far from other inhabited lands, new arrivals were infrequent. By the time a few finches arrived, a variety of habitats had developed where the birds could find food and other necessities of life. Food collection in the different habitats could be done most successfully by individuals with different features. A hungry finch pursuing insects under leaves or tree bark might succeed more often if its beak was narrower or longer than that of another finch. Opening a nourishing seedpod, one can assume, was easier for a finch with a beak that was a bit sturdier, or a bird with a more powerful bite. Because well-fed individuals were more energetic than their relatives were, they could sing louder, court better, build better nests, lay larger numbers of more healthy eggs, and leave more offspring. Over generations, finches exploiting different habitats began to acquire distinct sets of features inherited from their parents. Evolution happened. Today, more than thirteen species of finch share a common ancestry: the original few immigrants that were able to breed.

Over a year ago, the virus that is now spreading among human populations and causing COVID-19 invaded a human body for the first time. The variety of consequences of infection perplex us. It is agreed that we acquire infections by inhaling virus-laden watery droplets exhaled by an infected person. Subsequent events that happen when viruses land on the lining of the respiratory system remain under study. In regard to the coronaviruses that cause Severe Acquired Respiratory Syndromes (MERS, SARS-1 and SARS-2), the infectious particles display surface spikes that do what most proteins do; they get together with other proteins. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, molecules of a spike protein projecting from the viral surface get together with a protein (ACE2) present on several cell types that occur in the trachea, lungs and elsewhere. This human protein is one target (it is a binding site) of the spike protein. There are probably others; CD147, PPIA and PPIB are suspects (Beddingfield &amp; Bix, 2020). Different human cells may or may not display proteins that are targets for viral proteins. These characteristics together with the access that the virus particles have to the cell surfaces determine which cells are entered.

As chains of viral DNA and RNA replicate, errors occur. Viruses mutate. The details do not need to be known in order to follow this train of thought. It is enough to know that, over time, the genetic sequence of SARS-CoV-2 changes incrementally. Like the finches on the Galapagos Islands, variety enters the virus population.

In general, viruses that have grown in one host species will be neutralized or be unable to survive in a new host species, akin to our fates when we colonize planets other than Earth. Habitats and colonists are simply mismatched.  The system does not meet all the needs of the alien. Rarely, a novel virus finds conditions tolerable. Among those viruses, some express surface proteins that have affinities for molecules expressed on some host cells that they encounter. If such attractions occur, a virus particle may make its way into the cytoplasm of the cell. There, it may be able to unpack its genetic chemistry. It may be able to replicate, and even package the new RNA chains, as it must do. The newly packaged particles must escape from the cells in which they were made, avoid encountering and being recognized by components of the immune system, and get the host to transport them to a tissue site from where they can access another prospective host individual. This array of needs is quite demanding.

At first, a virus that has jumped to a new host species is not well adjusted to conditions in that new host. Nevertheless, inspired by Darwin’s creative imagination, we can see that variants, which emerge within the virus population, may differ in ways that affect each step of their life cycles. Those that, once replicated, are transported to the linings of the respiratory system may become launched in fluid droplets and may infect a new person.

During this first year of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have come to realize that symptoms and outcomes are highly variable from person to person. We find ourselves wondering: “If I get COVID, will I have any symptoms, or many symptoms? Will I get really sick? Will I become a “long hauler”? Will I die?”  By December 2020, we have identified both genetic and lifestyle attributes associated with differences in disease outcomes, but it remains impossible to predict that any single patient will be asymptomatic, incur mild or serious disease, experience a cytokine storm or a blood clotting disorder, or die. Nature reveals herself to us at a frustratingly slow pace. Both nature and nurture influence disease progression. However, just which elements of nature and of lifestyle have impacts? Are seasonal waves due to climate? How? How do effects interact? What are those impacts at the tissue, cellular and molecular levels? In addition, what determine the severity of each impact?

Currently, people are asking which of many candidate vaccines will prove most effective. The question exposes more voids in our knowledge; here our understanding of what underlays the potency (immunogenicity) of different formulations. The first approved vaccines are RNA vaccines and provoke host cells to make virus spike protein. Others will inject the protein itself.  Solvents and other components of each inoculum vary from one vaccine to another. Some aim to favor provocation of T-cell immunity whereas others putatively favor antibody production.

By the time of the next pandemic, we had better understand more about vaccine development and optimization for populations differing in geographic location, ethnicity, age, state of health and anything else (potentially host genetic variability) that influences human responses to vaccines. Not only vaccine composition, but dose size, dose number, dose interval, site of injection (or infusion, intra-nasal or intra-vascular), and immunostimulants; these are more topics about which uncertainties and voids exist in our knowledgebase.

Something concerns me more: the inevitability that SARS-CoV-2 is evolving or will evolve. This may underlay an important matter that is known to occur but for which explanations are hard to find - second waves. Why do they occur? Attentive observation, informed inference and experimental research have exposed some “what’s” and a few “how’s”, but essentially no “why’s” as to the ways of coronaviruses. Each virus may evolve into more than one strain. Different strains will likely differ in the identities of their target cells, the efficiency with which they accomplish host cell entry, un-packaging, replication, re-packaging, transport and transmission. These features will influence their pathogenicity and virulence. Add to those attributes the possibilities for antigenic shifts and evolution of resistance to therapeutic drugs (when these are developed and deployed) and we are confronted by more than a single truth. First, this pandemic benefits from multiple paths for adjustment to human hosts.  SARS-CoV-2 may change in transmission efficiency, host tissue specificity, virulence, capacity to survive on surfaces or elsewhere, and more. Second, we had better behave responsibly now and as we go forward, doing everything we can to put this virus behind us. Then let us do what we can to lessen chances of another pandemic that may be waiting in the wings. When that occurs, we must have used the present pandemic to inform ourselves about best strategies for diagnosis and treatment.

biology,"Hi everyone! I am new here and I really love the game series ""The Last of Us"" I will show you my biggest work for the fungus that causes the apocalypse in the game. I am presenting you. BTW it was an essay for school but no one listened ;(

""The Cordyceps""

The Cordyceps. A mushroom that is scientifically proven can turn ants into zombies. But why? And can this mushroom turn humans into zombies just like the poor South American ants?

Let’s start with some facts. Cordyceps is a fungus with about 400 species. It grows in tropical forests in Africa and South America. The Chinese, Japanese, and Nepal people believe this fungus is medicine for many diseases and especially helps the immune system.

Now let’s talk about the “zombie” ants. They infect while trying to find food but when they stumble into this fungus they are already dead. Not at the moment. But in the future, they will become zombies who want to bite everything in their category and little up. Quick note they DON’T want to eat brains like in science fiction films. It’s a little different. Yes, it infects the brain but doesn’t eat it, just infects it. The infection is in that the victim wants to spread the infection by biting which will get to the brain and…..make it think only for one thing: to spread the thing inside the “central core” of the thinking part of the brain.

The next thing I will discuss is the “*The Last of Us*” situation. There is that the fungus starts spreading at the city center in Austin, Texas. Technically the infection started a day ago. Why? Because the fungus needs between 6-48 hours to fully infect humans to stage zombies. So let’s get into the early story of the game. It’s summer 2013 and a father and daughter are surviving another day of the human race. After that when the girl (Sarah) is asleep her uncle calls and wants to talk with her dad (Joel). But he is not home. Then he comes from the back door and searches for his revolver to defend himself and his daughter. Then the neighbor Jimmy come ""turned”. Joel kills him with the revolver he found and ran off with his daughter in his brother’s car. We will jump 20 years later and head to another part of this masterpiece. And especially the part when we play the usual gameplay and see turned who have some like corals on their heads. Another time travel is two-three days later when Joel and the new characters Ellie and Bill find a big zombie. And when I say big I mean big. Now let’s go to the sequel of the game “*The Last of Us: Part II*” when we play as the second main character Abby where she goes to a hospital in Seattle, Washington State. There we meet “The Rat King” the most evolved form of zombie. What is in common with all these facts? This is the topic of the next chapter of this essay.

Let’s talk about the evolution of this fungus in our bodies. Do you remember Jimmy from a while ago? This is the first stage of the infection called “***The Runner***”. The host becomes in this stage in around 6-48 hours. The brain still works but tries to remove this infection from it. It’s shown when the runners pain moaning and make interrupted screams. From the name, we can say they run fast to infect.

The second stage is “***The Stalker***”. The features of this zombie infection stage are the “corals” which are coming from the eyes and the starting of practicing the “echolocation” which is used by bats. The brains start to stop work properly and make the victim do clicking noises which is the echolocation method.

The third stage is “***The Clicker***”. The name suggests the method they are moving. When they are well practiced with the echolocation thing they start moving by making clicking noises and try to hear the echo to find out where they are. For example near a wall or something. The corals from the eye are getting bigger and bigger and they become like hair, but at the face. At this stage, the brain is totally non-functional. An interesting fact is that the month is not affected by the infection because Cordyceps wants to spread.

From here I present more rare cases. The first one is “***The Bloater***”. This creature first feather is it’s wrapped all in this coral fungus. It forms for about 10 years. The chance to evolve to this stage is very rare. It’s hit is deadly strong.

The other strong option is “***The Shambler***”. It’s like the bloater but it can throw a bomb of spores while attacking. It’s almost impossible to be beaten while in a closed room because when it throws the bomb it explodes and makes a fog-like space where you can infect easily.

And before the last stage in which the victim is still alive and evolved in only one case is “***The Rat King***”. It’s the rarest stage and is actually a combination of the other zombies or how I like to say it “All in one”. There are shamblers, runners, stalkers, clickers. Well, every type except The Bloater. When the second main character fights The Rat King this zombie tears parts of itself which are different zombies and they start to attack you.

The last stage is the corpse. What do I mean? The corpse still got the spores and infection in it so in whatever stage is it the corpse starts to make a fungus which produces spores to continue the spreading at other victims. It usually forms in a closed room where the spores are densely.

The next chapter is the ways of spreading the infection. There are two ways of infection. The first way is by breathing the Cordyceps fungus spores. They will go to the lungs and you will start to cough hard. Let me add the fact said earlier that the host becomes a zombie between 6-48 hours. The second way by biting from infected. But here the chance is 50/50. The first 50 percents are to be alive but infected and the second is to be infected, and dead. This will make you a coral fungus. Dead coral fungus.

Before the last chapter of this essay is the immunization ways. Well not ways, I prefer way. Because it’s only you can become immune. But the chance again is very rare. The only way is the mother has to be infected and a few hours after the bite or the breathing of spores to born the child. Some of the genes will generate something like a vaccine for the fungus and will disable the person to become infected. But you cannot avoid at all the fungus. You will face it at least one time. So, for this reason, are the spores-protective masks, which will protect you if you aren’t immune.

And the last chapter is fully scientific. Can it actually become a zombie apocalypse? Well, I cannot answer this question with all my confidence. So I will answer how I think. In my opinion here is that the fungus doesn’t mutate enough to infect humans. After all, when scientists made experiments with infected ants they would become infected because they cannot feel the ant on the skin and it can bite them. So the apocalypse would start if it has mutated enough. But now the scientist knows about the danger so they are careful with this. But who knows? Maybe it will mutate enough to start the zombie apocalypse, but only maybe...

biology,"Hi all,

&amp;#x200B;

I am currently trying to find papers and official research into mental health genetics and mental health causes. I will explain below in more detail.

&amp;#x200B;

I am wanting to understand whether mental health disorders such as EUPD (Emotional Instability), Narcissism, Bipolar Disorder, Anxiety and Depression can be caused from genetics or are they solely environmentally caused?

&amp;#x200B;

For this next part I shall name the person in question ""Fran"".

Fran is in her mid 40's, married (petty arguments common with husband, never physically violent though), and has 4 children. The Children's sex and age are as follows.

Eldest Child: MALE,  19

Second Born: FEMALE, 18

Third Born: MALE, 15

Fourth Born: MALE, 11

&amp;#x200B;

The Husband (male, 48) has struggled with mental health for practically half of his life. He lost both his mum and dad at around the age of 18 and joined the army almost immediately after this. He met Fran and had 4 children with her. in early 04/05 he was diagnosed with diabetes. In recent years he has been admitted into psychiatric units for his safety (at least once a year he is admitted). In the past year he has lost practically all of his eye-sight and is registered sight-impaired, along with having a double transplant mid last year. He struggles with his emotions as he keeps it inside, and he has been diagnosed with multiple mental health disorders. He constantly has petty back-and-fourth arguments with the female child.

The oldest child (male, aged 19) was diagnosed with diabetes just after his father in 04/05. He has struggled with emotions and depression since the age of 11, from the age of 11 until 18 he would self harm almost daily. aged 17 he was admitted into a psychiatric unit following an attempted overdose. Whilst in the unit he continued to attempt suicide, along with head-banging and frictions burns that would cover his face and arms. He has been diagnosed with: Depression, Anxiety and EUPD, along with possible bipolar.

The second oldest child (female, 18) has possibly suffered with mental health issues for the past couple years, led from witnessing and being around her father and oldest brother whilst they attempted suicide. Admitted into a psychiatric unit mid 2020, she was released with the diagnosis of psychological un-development and adjustment disorder. Eldest child has done some research as well as talking to his physiatrist and both the physiatrist and him agree that it is more than likely she has underlying narcissistic traits.

&amp;#x200B;

The third child (male, 15) acts oblivious to this all but knows what is going on. He has not been diagnosed with any disorders as of yet, however there is a possibility due to the things he has witnessed and heard.

&amp;#x200B;

The youngest child (male, 11) is also diabetic and this has had a huge impact on his life. He is awaiting multiple diagnosis's such as ASD and mental health disorders led on from the trauma of the diabetic diagnosis. Around the ages of 7-10 he would constantly take about death, say that he wanted to die and also head-bang, this has all since stopped since coming out of public school to be home-schooled.

&amp;#x200B;

Fran (mother, female, 45) has never been diagnosed with mental health disorders however has struggled with all of the issues presented in the past decade. She has been prescribed sertraline from the doctors but has been advised only to take it when needed (she is stubborn and says she doesn't ever need it). It has been suggested that she may also have EUPD along with the eldest son. She is denying any possibility of mental health disorders and says she is ""just emotional"".

&amp;#x200B;

Please can i have a professionals opinion and answer, or official papers or research to the above information. I would like to know how likely it is that Fran has mental health issues, along with mental health and genetics.

I am a junior undergraduate biology major who is on the pre-medical track. The title says it all; I like biology too much and I want to get a Ph.D. in molecular biology. A medical school is a great place to be, but I don't think I will be happy as a practicing physician. I can spend hours and hours learning and researching more about my research subject. Time flies when I am analyzing the dataset I have gathered over time.

I go to a small liberal arts college, and my CV resembles that of a traditional pre-medical student with a high GPA (3.99) and lots of community service hours. Research-wise, I have a first author paper coming up (hopefully ready for submission by March 2021), and I hope to write another one by the time I graduate. I also presented my poster at multiple international conferences. I understand that GPA doesn't really matter when it comes to graduate school acceptances, but I am afraid as to where my CV stands compared to other applicants.

My questions are:

1. Would I have a chance at top R1 schools? What could I do to amp up my CV before graduation?
2. What would I need to expect applying to Ph.D. programs; what is it like as a Ph.D. candidate?

biology,"Introduction 

Glycolysis and gluconeogenesis are controlled within the cell so that while one is relatively inactive, the other is highly active. If both pathways were highly active simultaneously, it would result in the net loss of 2ATP and 2GTP. Both pathways are highly exergonic under cellular conditions, meaning there is no thermodynamic barrier to them happening simultaneously. However, the amounts and activities of the enzymes within both pathways are reciprocally controlled to prevent simultaneous high activity. The 3 main ways in which this is controlled by allosteric control, level of signal metabolite and hormonal control.

Allosteric control 

One way in which the switch between the pathways is controlled is by allostery, this is the process by which enzymes can have their activity changed by molecules joining onto sights other than the active site. The key enzymes involved in whether the cell chooses to have glycolysis or gluconeogenesis active are, for glycolysis hexokinase, phosphofructokinase-1 and pyruvate kinase, for gluconeogenesis glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6- bisphosphatase, PEP carboxylase and pyruvate carboxylase. The final being phosphofructokinase-2, this will be discussed separately.

(There is a figure here showing the enzymes involved in the reciprocal control between the pathways with both allosteric inhibitors and activators listed for the enzymes) 

The way in which the switch between pathways is controlled allosterically can be seen in figure 1. For example, Phosphofructokinase-1 is allosterically activated by Adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6-Bp) but fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase the enzyme responsible for the opposite action of phospfructokinase-1 is allosterically inhibited by AMP and F2,6-Bp. It is by having one molecule acting as an allosteric activator in glycolysis but an allosteric inhibitor in gluconeogenesis and vice versa, that forms the basis for reciprocal control.

Signal Metabolite 

Another way in which the switch between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis is controlled is using the bifunctional enzyme phosphofructokinase-2 (PFK-2), which uses a signal metabolite fructose 2,6-bisphosphate (F2,6-Bp) to reciprocally control the rate limiting enzymes of glycolysis which is PFK-1 and gluconeogenesis which is fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase. This is done by altering the level of F2,6-Bp present in the cell.
PFK-2 has 2 domains, PFK-2 which phosphorylates fructose 1,6-bisphosphate to 2,6- bisphosphate and fructosebisphosphatase-2 which dephosphorylates fructose 2,6- bisphosphate to fructose 1,6-bisphosphate. Depending on the phosphorylation state of the enzymeonedomaincanbeintheinactiveTstatewhilsttheotherisintheactiveR-state. For example, when PFK-2 is phosphorylated by a kinase the PFK-2 domain is in the inactive T state and the fructosebisphosphatase-2 domain is in the active R-state, this results in the reduction of F-2,6Bp levels in the cell, in turn PFK-1 is slowed down as it has less of the allosteric activator but on the other hand fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase is activated because there is less of the allosteric inhibitor present. So therefore, by controlling the PFK-2 enzyme the cell indirectly controls the switching between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis.

Hormonal control 

Hormonal control is the final way in which the switch between the two pathways is controlled. Using the anabolic hormone insulin and the catabolic hormone glucagon, the hormones are able to control the switching by indirectly controlling the level of the single metabolite F2,6-Bp. For example, insulin binds causing the production of cAMP phosphodiesterase which deactivates protein kinase A through the break down of cAMP. The deactivation of protein kinase A stops the phosphorylation of PFK-2 and therefore stops the PFK-2 domain being inactivated. Secondly insulin also activates phosphoprotein phosphatase, which dephosphorylates the PFK-2 domain, allowing it to go into the active R-state. Both of these affects in turn cause the increase in F2,6Bp levels, causing the cell to switch to glycolysis. However, glucagon is the reverse of this, it activates protein kinase A, which phosphorylates the PFK-2 domain inactivating it. This results in the fructosebisphosphatase-2 remaining in the R state and therefore decreasing F2,6Bp levels, causing the cell to stimulate gluconeogenesis.


Figure 2, representation of PEP carboxykinase gene promoter region. 


The second way in which hormones are able to control the switching of the pathways is through gene expression. For example, Glucagon enhances expression of PEP carboxykinase and fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase see fig 2 but acts as a transcriptional silencer for PFK-1 and pyruvate kinase switching the cell to gluconeogenesis (Goldstein et al, 2018). By mediating the amount of certain enzymes present the cell can control which pathway is favoured.

biology,"&gt;Mast cell researcher Lawrence Afrin, M.D., posits that a rare condition called mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) may be the cause of the phenomenon. In MCAS, mast cells spontaneously release over 200 inflammatory molecules known as mediators, including the substance noradrenaline (norepinephrine). Afrin describes a case report of a man with MCAS who grew ill and appeared to ""smoke"" in the presence of several witnesses. Afrin writes that the release of large amounts of norepinephrine, or perhaps another mast cell-derived substance, could turn on a regulatory protein called UCP-1 in greater-than-normal amounts. UCP-1 causes adipose oxidization to be released as heat. Adipose tissue is a known repository of mast cells. Under the right circumstances, a sudden flood of norepinephrine released from adipose mast cells could activate the UCP-1 ""switch"" and cause heat generation in excess of 90 degrees Celsius. Once the adipose tissue were ignited, it would in theory burn itself out, inclusive of bone marrow.[26]",Is this plausible?

The witnesses assumed it    was a gas jet fire, but firefighters got a surprise - they found a    homeless man named Robert Francis Bailey, and found the fire was coming    from him. In his abdomen was a 5 inch ''slit'', and blue flames were    roaring out of this slit like a blow-torch. The fire was put out, but    Bailey had died. Bailey was rumored to drink meths (known as Sterno)  but   he was a non-smoker.

Did they ever find out what exactly had happened to him? Was there a criminal investigation? 

&amp;#x200B;

Was he murdered ? 



The firefighter who witnessed this event had this to say;

&gt;When I got in through the window I found the body of a tramp named Bailey laying at the bottom of the stairs leading up to the second floor. He was lying partly on his left side. ***There was a four-inch slit in his abdomen from which was issuing, at force, a blue flame.*** The flame was beginning to burn the wooden stairs. We extinguished the flames by playing a hose into the abdominal cavity. Bailey was alive when he started burning. He must have been in terrible pain. His teeth were sunk into the mahogany newel post of the staircase. I had to prise his jaws apart to release the body. The fire was coming from within the abdomen of his body.


Did they ever find out what exactly had happened to him? Was there a criminal investigation?

biology,"I considered the above while answering a mock assessment question and now I'm curious.

The question was asking me to detail selective tradeoffs in a prey species which is brightly coloured for mating purposes. On one hand, bright colouration increases the prey's visibility and therefore its risk of predation, but on the other hand small changes in colour can hugely improve mating success, so overall you see an equilibrium where an increase in predation causes selection for duller colouration in the prey, while a drop in predation will produce greater selection for bright colouration. The only conspicuous predators I can think of don't rely on any kind of cryptic hunting strategy (and are actually all aposematic) but I suppose the same tradeoff *could maybe* be possible in reverse.

What I'm interested in is a predator- prey relation where this tradeoff dynamic doesn't exist, and either the predator or prey organism is simultaneously visually conspicuous to females, and visually cryptic to its ""opponent"".

Here's my thinking so far:

 I first considered whether positively cryptic markings (camouflage) could simultaneously serve as a sexual signal, but as visual detection would then be highly selected for both conspecifics *and* prey I can't see how this'd work.

Secondly I thought about whether structural differences in the eyes of predator and prey could call it- you might have read about [tiger](https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/we-now-know-why-tigers-bright-orange-color-is-actually-excellent-camouflage/) [colouration](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsif.2019.0183) (what appears bright orange to us is background-matching to the tiger's prey due to their dichromatic eyes). Unfortunately apart from primates all mammals (including tigers themselves) are dichromats, but tiger colouration does show that what is rather vividly coloured to one eye type may be cryptic in the context of predator-prey. A hypothetical ""vision-savvy"" prey might bear markings which were highly visible to conspecifics, but cryptic to predators. The fact that despite any selective benefits which trichromat vision grants to primates, we are the **only mammal group** in which it reevolved might point to something like this being stable long-term.

What do you reckon? Any examples or suggestions would be much appreciated, and thanks for reading this far!","Is it possible for an animal to be brightly coloured for sexual signalling, but positively cryptic to predators?"

So one thing about covid that I have seen discussed around reddit is the potential for animal reservoirs to reduce the effectiveness of a vaccination and eradication effort. 

My understanding is that once a virus is in an animal, better adapted versions will be more likely to reproduce, and that as time goes on there will be an accumulation of mutations, the end result being the virus is more adapted to the reservoir animal than humans. This is how an attenuated vaccine was developed for polio, by infecting rats (mice?) and harvesting the virus after generations of infections.

But logically, this means that any animal reservoir should be short lived before disappearing, and yet they exist. There must be something I'm missing.

What is their chances that their baby will have the disease?

===========

&amp;#x200B;

Since it’s not X linked, the gender of the parents don’t matter as much.

&amp;#x200B;

I’m trying to wrap my head around it. The grandparents of the mother could be carriers or affected.

&amp;#x200B;

If one grandparent was affected and another was a carrier, then the parents of the mother and parents of the first cousin is 1/2 carriers and 1/2 affected.

&amp;#x200B;

So 1/2 chance that the first cousin is a carrier. The first cousin and the mother also have a 1/2 chance of passing it to the baby. 

&amp;#x200B;

So 1/2\* 1/2 = 1/4? 

&amp;#x200B;

But if the one of the grandparents were homozygous for the disease and the other grandparent was unaffected, would the chances be 1/8? 

&amp;#x200B;

The chances the grandparents passed it down to the parent would be zero, but all children will be carriers. The carrier children will grow up to be carriers parents. The carrier parent will marry another carrier to produce the diseased woman in this question. 

&amp;#x200B;

The diseased woman would marry her first cousin who is a carrier. 

1/2\*1/2\*1/2 = 1/8?

So which is it?

biology,"We were in an Cessna 172 for a mountain a few miles away from the city. Midway out, we were caught in a storm and blown off course. The turbulence was terrible. When the storm cleared, we were in a dense fog. We began to hear strange noises, rather like the roaring of a dragon . . . also a sickening odor like that of a dead fish. The noise got closer to the Cessna and it was then we heard a loud hissing sound.

Out of the fog we saw what looked like a huge dragon, about 40 feet in length, flying straight up out of the clouds. Its wings looked bat-like. It appeared several more times, getting closer to our aircraft. The silence was broken once again by something out of the fog. I can only describe it as a high-pitched whine. We panicked. All five of us put on our seatbelts and we went full throttle . . . 'Keep together and we'll try for the landing strip!' I yelled.

After we were in the clouds, we became confused in the fog. From behind I could hear the screams of my comrades one by one as it tore the plane's tail section off. I got a closer look at the thing just before my last friend fell out the plane. The neck was about 12 feet long, brownish-green and smooth looking. The head was like that of a sea-turtle, except more elongated with teeth. There appeared to be what looked like a dorsal fin when it flew past for the last time. Also, as best I am able to recall, the eyes were green with oval pupils.

I finally made it to the landing strip, the top of which protruded from the side of the mountain, and stayed there for most of the night. Early that morning I hiked back to the base of the mountain and was found by the rescue unit",Something in the sky attacked my plane and took my friends with it

I need help from someone that can read through my essay below and tell me if I did good on explaining what pseudoscience, and science, is. 
Also bringing up how they differ, and giving examples. Please let me know if I should elaborate on anything.

&gt; In order for an understanding regarding something to be described as scientific, one needs to substantiate it with observations, experiments, and measurements. A researcher can ask some questions regarding what is to be investigated, in order to then be able to set up a hypothesis, which is a postulation regarding the function of something. The hypothesis is then tested methodically through an experiment, the hypothesis may change if it turns out to be wrong. If the hypothesis proves to be true, and becomes a theory, then this can be used to sum up the theory. A theory is more or less a system of ideas that are meant to explain a phenomenon, and can be built on the hypothesis. Examples of scientific theories can be the cell theory, or the theory of evolution, wherein the former, it has been established that all living beings consist of cells. The theory of evolution says that life on earth began from a common primordial archetype.

&gt; An example of pseudoscience is intelligent design, that is, a creature may have been behind living nature. Another example of pseudoscience is phrenology, where the placement of properties such as ""Selfish"" or ""intelligence"" is compartmentalized on the surface of the brain, of which elevations on the surface of the skull in these separate sections correspond to well-developed characteristics. Thus, this pseudoscience was used to make a judgment about someone's character based on the structure of the skull.


&gt; What typifies pseudoscience is that one claims something is true because an authority, e.g. an academic, has made that claim. Another qualifying feature for something to be pseudoscience is that you use examples selectively that can support a hypothesis, while ignoring the insignificant, that is, what speaks against the hypothesis. The problem with this can then be that you do not put things in perspective, and think about the context in which these examples arise. You can also use this example as a premise to draw a conclusion. The problem, however, is that it is a logical fallacy, an argumentation error.

&gt; Another phenomenon is unfalsifiability, where claims that form the basis of a so-called theory cannot be substantiated by experiments, and therefore experiments are rejected. To give an example, we can talk about a creator of all life, but scientists then wonder how one can come to the conclusion that the creator exists without experiment as evidence for the claims. Therefore, it remains pseudoscience, and only a metaphysical hypothesis.

&gt; What can be said more about pseudoscience, in the form of phenomena, are observations that lack repeatability. In order for it to not to be pseudoscience, you need to have made observations or experiments with similar results. A person cannot claim to have seen a ghost, and therefore conclude that ghosts exist. It should be more or less possible to demonstrate.",Need help with this assignment on the scientific method

Witnesses saw what looked like flames coming from another building, so they called the fire brigade. When the firefighters got to the scene, they saw a bizarre sight - he had a 4 to 5 inch tear in his abdomen, and blue flames were 'roaring' out of this tear ''like a blow-torch''. The firemen saw that he was still alive while this was happening and he seemed to be in a lot of pain. The firemen inserted a hose into his abdominal tear to put the flames out, with difficulty. No sources of external ignition or gas were found in the abandoned building that he was sleeping in.

A documentary (which is available on YouTube, if anyone is interested!) featured a harrowing reconstruction of this case, where Bailey was sleeping, but awoke to pains in his stomach. He then cried out in pain shortly followed by flames bursting from his abdomen.

The most common flammable gas in the intestine is hydrogen gas, which can be found in concentrations of up to ~50%. Is there enough oxygen gas within the human intestine for hydrogen to ignite, and if so, what would ignite it and would it cause the abdomen to tear open and emit flames?",Is it plausible that a person's intestinal gasses suddenly ignited and burned them to ash?

biology,"Okay, so I've been studying a bit in my biology book for an exam and stumbled upon something kinda weird. It reads that there's about 700 million (don't really know if this is the correct word but I'd guess it's the one I'm searching for) alveolus in our lunges and that they each are 0.5 mm in diameter. I wanted to calculate how long it would be if I put it in a single line just for some entertainment. 

I first did:

0.5 times 700000000 

to get the length. But getting it in mm doesn't really give a very good of a picture of how long it actually is. So I took:

350000000 divided by 1000

to get it in meters. Which is 350000 meters, which is kinda a lot of meters so I wanted to make it kilometres.

350000 divided by 1000

which is 350. Which still is a lot. But then on the next page, it reads (just a rough translation) ""if you were to put all of the alveoli of a human in a single line it would be the size of half a tennis court"".

I'm pretty sure that a tennis court is not that big. Did I make mistake or has the book made something incorrect?

biology,"Ok, I want to talk about mass stupidity and intentional deception of the public by the scientific community.

I want to talk about the evolution theory in specific.

If you ask a person for an evidence for evolution happening today, one of the more likely answers would be bacteria becoming resistant to antibiotics. You even have video like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plVk4NVIUh8), made by the supposedly prestigious Harvard institution, claiming to show how bacteria is ""evolving"".

Ok... let me go back  for a second... first of all, what is evolution? You will be surprised to discover, that this term ""evolution"" wasn't even defined in an accurate way.... it is defined in a way that you can't work with.  It's pretty clear that the scientific community presents to the public this thing ""evolution"" as a process that it is responsible  for the creation of all living species today from a single cell organisms, due to effect of random mutations and natural selection.

But the official definition is "" **Evolution** is change in the [heritable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heredity) [characteristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phenotypic_trait) of biological [populations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population) over successive [generations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation). "" (according to wikipedia)

Now... this is like so stupid... how can you define ""evolution"" in such way? It is automatically assumes that if DNA can change, then it is ""evolution"", therefore all living species had evolved from single cell organisms... this a basic logical fallacy.

Let me show you some examples:

\-For example we have a cave fish that lost its eyes, due to change of its habitat environment, since there is constant darkness in the cave, the fish no longer need eyes, so it lost it over a certain amount of generations.

Now the scientists will call this ""Evolution"", and use it as proof that land animal can become a whale, or that bacteria can grow a flagellum.

Don't you see the obvious fallacy in this way of thinking?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Another example is the bacteria resistance to antibiotics. In this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plVk4NVIUh8) produced by Harvard, the public is made to believe that when bacteria adjusts to different levels of antibiotics, it ""evolves"", and therefore it proves that ""evolution"" is true. 

When in fact when you look into it, the mutations that the bacteria go through in order to beat antibiotics, are always about losing parts, or somehow reorganizing its existing parts, but not creating new parts.

It's like... let say we have an combat airplane that needs to beat enemy anti-air missiles... so first missile locks on plane radar, so we deactivate it and our plane becomes invisible to it... ok we beat it.

Next missile uses heat signature... ok so we add another engine to our plane so it can go higher, and we manage to beat that missile...

Ok now the enemy makes the missile to be able to go higher... ok so we make our plane to go faster, by reducing the size of fuel cells and making it lighter... ok now our plane is able to beat the missile, but the trade off it has now a shorter range.

So as you see we could adjust our plane to beat all those AA missiles, but it wasn't ""evolution"". We didn't upgrade the plane, we didn't create any new technology or new parts. We just lost the radar, we added another identical engine, and we made our fuel cells smaller... that's it.

&amp;#x200B;

So the bottom line is that we can't call 3 different total processes by same name ""evolution"": species evolving from one cell organism (**creation of new information**), fish losing eyes (**losing information**) and bacteria adapting to antibiotics (**limited reorganization of existing information**),  and then use one to prove the other. You can't use a case of losing information as a proof for a theoretical case of creation of information.... it's 2 totally different and opposite things.

This is basic logical fallacy and mass stupidity... and I blame the scientific community, including the supposedly prestigious Harvard institute, for deceiving the public and making people dumb.

Can organisms and DNA adapt to some extent to their environment? Yes they can. Does it mean that it proves that all species are result of random mutations on an ancestor single cell organism? No, it doesn't. Just like the fact that Grammarly and Autocorrect can improve my text doesn't mean that these programs can write a novel. Just because we can make a [self modifying software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-modifying_code), doesn't mean it can create new games or programs...

So I want to sum up.... the bottom line that the fact that majority of population thinks that bacteria adapting to antibiotics is ""evolution"", and that it proves that ""Evolution"" from single cell to human is real, is sheer mass stupidity, logical fallacy and idiotism... and I blame the scientific community for being stupid by itself, and also misleading the public into thinking that kind of nonsense. 

Now people that make such an obvious and stupid fallacy, and aren't even able to give accurate definitions to the terms that are using, can be treated seriously, I'm sorry.... you want to believe in evolution? That 's fine.... but bring real arguments to the table, and don't just say ""oh look the bacteria became resistant to antibiotics and fish lost its eyes, that means all life on earth came from single cell organism""... because it's just silly. It's like we live in some medieval ages, before the enlighten era... common people, use your brain.",Mass stupidity and deception by the scientific community

biology,"I've heard many people throughout my life tell me that germs are everywhere.  And I've also been told that germs eventually die (much quicker if there is a lack of food and water).  But these two statements contradict each other if ""germs being everywhere"" is interpreted literally.  I always thought when people said this they literally meant everywhere.  But how can there be germs everywhere if there are certain places germs don't really survive very well.  For example, the ceiling.  Do you really expect me to believe there's germs on the ceiling despite having no food or water to survive?  Therefore they will die and not reproduce.  Same goes for the walls (if they are not being touched by people or animals).  There is no food or water for the germs to survive, so they will die and not reproduce.  I could keep going with examples like this (assuming people aren't touching these surfaces): Windows, blinds, TV, the sides and bottom of all furniture (and parts that are not touched on the top), all doors (the door itself, not the door handle), the bottom of the bed, etc.  As long as these surfaces, or any surfaces, are not touched and do not have food or water for germs to survive, then they have no germs.  
And that's a lot of surfaces, so to say germs are ""everywhere"" is quite an exaggeration.  Yes, it's true that germs can float in the air and land on surfaces, but I can't imagine billions of germs doing this in a small area to a few surfaces.  The amount of germs that would occasionally land on surfaces probably wouldn't be very much, and like I said, they would not survive for very long without food and water.  So again, germs can't literally be ""everywhere"".  The places you would expect to usually find germs is where there is food and water, like the sink, toilet, bathtub, floor, door handles, TV remote, your mouth, several places outside, etc.  So like I said, germs are not literally ""everywhere"".

Basically, when you start learning physics, you start with people like Newton. He made his discoveries all the way back in the 1600s. When you study chemistry the earliest material covered is usually the elements. Well, naturally you begin to talk about the discoveries of alchemists and such and how they characterized things, and then you jump ahead to the discovery of the periodic table, and that sorta thing. Then you move onto the gas laws and stuff which were discovered in the 1700s or so. So basically, for physics and chemistry, many of the most basic elemental discoveries took place far earlier in history (i.e. start of the scientific revolution). Yes, both were revolutionized later on (both incidentally in the 20th century because of quantum and nuclear mechanics) but many important principles were laid down early on. Other than the invention of the microscope and the discoveries of Mendel, damn near everything covered in biology courses I have taken throughout my life primarily focus on the 20th century discoveries.

The question just occurred to me because I know of someone who is of low IQ (diagnosed with intellectual impairment) and their family life seemed great and their other siblings all turned out perfectly normal.

biology,"  The phenomene in which enzyme fail to catalyze a reaction is called enzyme inhibition
First question that arise in our mind is that why enzyme fail to catalyze a reaction? Answer is enzyme fails to catalyze a reaction due to ENZYME INHIBITOR
What is enzyme inhibitor?
It is a substance that attach to enzyme but not change into product
Why enzyme inhibitor not change into product?
Enzyme inhibitor may be similar to substrate or not. Take first condition in which enzyme inhibitor similar to substate so it attach to active site of enzyme. But it is not 100% similar due to which enzyme doesnot change into product and in result enzyme active site don't available for substrate because it is attach to enzyme inhibitor. Second condition is that when enzyme inhibitor is not similar to substrate. If it is not similar to substrate then how it attach to active site? Actually this type of enzyme inhibitor doesnot attach to active site. It attach to enzyme other then binding site which is known as ALLOSTERIC SITE. As a result enzymes activity stops
TYPES OF ENZYME INHIBITION:
1-Competitive inhibition
2-Non-competitive inhibition

COMPETITIVE INHIBITION:

A type of enzyme inhibition in which enzyme activity is blocked by the presence of chemical which is competing with substrate to get bind with active site. As we discussed that enzyme inhibitor is similar to substrate in that case both substrate and inhibitor trying to attach to active site mean their goal was same because both have ability to get bind with active site. The level of inhibition is depend on the releative concentration of substrate and inhibitor, If the concentration of substrate is increased releative to the concentration of the inhibitor, the active site will usually  be occupied by the substratee. Usually competitive inhibition is temporary, and the inhibitor evantually leaves the enzyme hence it is also called REVERSIBLE INHIBITION. An example of competitive inhibitor is MALONATE

NON-COMPETITIVE INHIBITION:

In non-competitive inhibition inhibitor molecule binds to an enzyme other then active site. The other binding site of enzyme is called ALLOSTERIC SITE. The non-competitive inhibitor is of two type
1-Reversible non-competitive inhibitor
2-Irreversible non-competitive inhibitor:
Reversible non-competitive enzyme inhibitor  block the enzyme active temporaly. They don't work by preventing the formation of enzyme-substrate complex, but work by preventing enzyme-product complex. Feedback inhibition is a type of this inhibition
Irreversible non-competitive enzyme inhibitor block the enzyme activity by changing its shape so in this way substrate cannot bind to the active site. Example of such inhinitor are cyanides and salts of heavy metal. Cyanides are potent poison for living organism because they can block the enzyme cytochrome oxidase essential for cellular respiration. They block this activity by combining with iron present in prosthetic group. Ions of heavy metal can block the enzyme activity by combining with tiol group(-SH) in the enzyme breaking the disulphide bridge. These bridges are important for keeping tertiary structure of enzyme. When these bridges are broken enzyme become denaturered and inactive.

FEEDBACK INHIBITION:

When activity of enzyme is inhibited by its own product. It is called feedback inhibition
Example:
Amino acid asparate become amino acid threonine by a sequence of five enzymetic reaction. When threonine(last product) is present in large amount. Its bind to allostratic site of enzyme1 on this pathway. In this conversion of asparate into threonine stops. As threonine use by celllular events its amount decreases and finally it would completely consumed then threonine leave active site of enzyme 1 on this pathway and threonine production again started

However, I have no idea if any of these are relevant to HER2 as I just can’t find any specific information on that.

I seem to be really good at chatting to people, making them feel comfortable, and getting them excited about my projects.

biology,"I was talking to someone about this. I stated that there are larger genetic differences within Africans than between Africans and Eurasians, so racial naturalism is false or (at least) problematic. They stated that- ""Well, cars have more variation or higher range than trucks. People have more choices in cars. But that does not mean that categories of cars and trucks are not valid. Similarly, your argument does not mean race realism is false.""

So the person I am talking to, well, to put it bluntly, is racist. They believe that race realism is correct, and the IQ differences between races are mostly genetic. Black/brown people have low IQ while White/Asian(far east Asian) people have average IQ. As such (according to them), white people and black/brown people should not interbreed because interbreeding can be dysgenic. Even if a black/brown person has a high IQ, it is still not good because IQ is genetic. The child of a high IQ brown/black person and an average IQ white person would still have a high possibility of having a low IQ because of genes. High IQ black/brown people are born because of chance similar to very high IQ white people, but the genes people are still there. They also consider that racial diversity to be a bad thing for society.

Now, I am trying to criticize their view and bring them to the nonracist side here. Otherwise, they would continue to promote these views and encourage people to ""not breed"" with black/brown people because of genetic IQ differences. And their view can also turn into outright fascism if I don't stop them or don't continually challenge their views. They like to talk to me. I think I can change their views, but I need some arguments. I am not as smart as them, who can make arguments on the fly. This is why I need some help from here.

Can anyone help me give arguments against racial naturalism? Is racial naturalism a defeated view in biology or philosophy?

Hi everybody! I am currently a Master’s student and would love to be a field research ecologist after I get my PhD, so I still have a little while to work out details job wise. However, I had a question that I’m hoping to get some more clarification on. 

Recently, we had a guest professor speak in one of our classes about potential jobs and one of them was working in a museum. I didn’t really know that was an option, so I’m glad she brought it up! I asked my advisor about curator positions and what that meant and the daily activities. He said he wasn’t exactly positive on everything but knows a guy that I could talk to in the summer when we go do our field research, covid willing. I did google about curator positions, but the info was geared more towards art and history. When I typed in “science,” the information was very basic and didn’t offer much insight. 

I’m wondering if anyone here knows much about curator jobs. Are you able to have this job on top of doing research for some other entity? I am 100% certain that I want to do research in the future. What exactly is a curator’s day to day working like? I’m sure this varies from museum to museum depending on size and things like that.

I'm trying to get to the biological root of why some vaccines create antibodies and memory cells that are effective for long periods of time (polio, HPV, ...) and others - such as the influenza vaccine - have to be administered annually to provide any sort of protection against the seasonal flu. I'm curious about viral mutation rates: what features of the poliovirus precludes it from mutating into something that can circumvent our series of vaccines that are generally considered ""good for life""? How is it different from the influenza virus in this specific aspect?

Bonus: Is gene mutation guaranteed to occur occasionally at a fundamental level in biology? Is there an example of bit-perfect genetic/cellular replication at the enzyme/RNA level somewhere in nature? Are *all* viruses guaranteed to mutate given natural selective pressures?

biology,"My post got removed from r/neuroscience. I don't know if this is the appropriate forum to post this. But here it goes.

Hi, my interest just got a hop from astrophysics (blackholes, mostly general relativity) to physics (quantum mechanics, general relativity and unification theories, multiverse and other quantum things) to cosmology (origin of the universe) to oncology to cell biology (abiogenesis) to molecular biology/genetics (genetic engineering, recombinant DNA tech, biotechcthings) and now I'm interested in brains, thoughts, how thoughts are made, imaginations, mind, feelings, emotions, consciousness and other things. (neuroscience). Can someone tell what branch is my interest, specifically.

Basically I want to learn abiogenesis from a question where does life come from? (How do the very first cell come to life, and if they are made of the same matter that make the non living.), then it got shifted from one to another but it returns back, what is feelings? emotions? what is brains? how it gives feelings, consciousness and specifically thoughts and what is information? and seems like how everything rise from universe to cells to everything. Seems like physics, biology and neuroscience mixed up together and then that question is formed.

So my question is what branch of neuroscience deals with that question? I'm really interested in fundamentals of everything, answering origins, but not philosophically, I want to do it scientifically, where I can measure and perform experiments that's what I really love. Any thoughts? Thanks!

But the main plan of my life is here, take B.S. Biology, get Diploma in Chem, Physics and take M.S. Neuroscience, and then M.S.

biology,"Dogs have evolved muscles in their eyebrows to make them look more 'cute' for humans, manipulating us. It is one of the only (if not the only, at least that I can think of) instances where one organism has undergone evolutionary changes of aesthetic traits for another organism. Scientists found that dogs, when people were looking at them, were more likely to be adopted if they show this specific eyebrow movement. Lifting these eyebrow muscles can make their eyes look bigger. We can't seem to find another purpose for these muscles, besides giving us 'puppy dog eyes'. We also don't know if they have voluntary control over this method to manipulate us, humans.

This muscle (abbreviated as LAOM) is COMPLETELY absent in wolves (they have some very rudimentary or simple muscle fibres there, but no functionality), whom we hypothesize dogs evolved from. They also found that Siberian Huskies (most closely related to wolves), don't have this muscle either. Pointing towards the fact that dogs developed a muscle in their eyebrow after domestication from wolves

It's also pretty recent and seemed to evolve into these muscles in the last 33,000 years (in evolution that is VERY QUICK). Since this movement causes a larger desire for humans to look after the dogs after they make this 'eyebrow gesture' it seems that this would be an evolutionary advantage for those dogs to find companionship.

Please help me by sharing your thoughts on how I should restructure my text, or if I should elaborate somewhere, etc. thank you in advance:

&gt;Organic compounds consist of molecules that have a carbon skeleton, that is, it has a chain of carbon atoms that form the basis of an organic molecule. Organic substances are high in energy, and some of them are used as fuels, e.g. substances contained in petrol. The molecules consist of carbon and hydrogen, and when these are combusted, during the formation of carbon dioxide, we have a reaction between the carbon atoms and oxygen. The hydrogen atoms in the molecules can also react with oxygen during combustion, and from this, water molecules are formed. Plants are made up of organic substances, and when they burn, carbon dioxide and water vapour are formed. The energy in these is converted into heat and light energy. Humans, and other living things, also consist of organic compounds, such as carbohydrates, protein, and fat. In order for the carbon atoms not to run out in nature, they must be reusable, which is why we have something called the carbon cycle. The cycle contains molecules from carbon dioxide and glucose. Plants can form glucose through photosynthesis, and the carbon atoms needed for glucose are derived from the carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere (air), which is an extremely small proportion, 0.039%.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to carbon dioxide, plants need water and energy to produce glucose. The plants convert light energy from the sun, or lamps, into the green substance chlorophyll that is found in the plants' leaves, as this is where light energy is collected. During photosynthesis, oxygen is formed, in addition to glucose, and released to the environment. The reaction of photosynthesis can most easily be described according to this formula:  
&gt;  
&gt;light energy + carbon dioxide + water ⟶ glucose + oxygen.  
&gt;  
&gt;Six carbon molecules, and water molecules, together with light energy, gives us an excess of oxygen atoms, which is why oxygen is formed. Thus, the oxygen present in the atmosphere of the planet is formed by photosynthesis. At the same time as photosynthesis is driven by light energy, the energy released during cellular respiration is of a corresponding amount, and is converted into heat, which is then radiated from organisms. Energy has no reuse in a cycle, like carbon, because it radiates from organisms into space. This means that the sun has a great impact on the life that exists on our earth.  
&gt;  
&gt;Glucose are classified as simple sugars, monosaccharides, from which we can derive much of our energy. Humans get glucose, and other energy-rich nutrients, with the food that are eaten. Animals, as well as plants, go through a process called cellular respiration where glucose is used as fuel, and where carbon dioxide and water are formed. This is how carbon dioxide comes back into the atmosphere.  
&gt;  
&gt;Organic substances found in dead plants and animals are decomposed by decomposers (e.g. fungi and bacteria). But even decomposers have cellular respiration that helps the air get back carbon dioxide. It is worth noting that plants, and animals, that die in cold climates, or where the environment is anaerobic, which makes it difficult for decomposers to break down decayed animals and plants. These plants and animal residues can be stored for a long time without being completely degraded. Over time, they are processed to become coal, oil, or natural gas, i.e. fossil fuels, which were stored in the ground for millions of years. When we burn fossil fuels, carbon dioxide is released into the air, and so the cycle continues.

biology,"When a person is wronged or hurt, the desire for revenge can be extremely powerful, and history is full of examples of victims of abuse, families of murdered loved ones, or other victims exacting revenge on their attacker or abuser.  

Revenge could be a behavior that is rewarded by evolution, since if a person who was wronged successfully gets revenge on an enemy, they have eliminated a potential threat, thus making themselves more likely to survive, have children, and pass on their genes. But revenge could also backfire, since by seeking revenge, a person is engaging in a conflict that could result in their own injury or death, leaving them less likely to have offspring and pass on their genes. 

Conventional wisdom often suggests that seeking revenge is a harmful, ultimately unhealthy behavior.   Focusing on revenge is often suggested to do more harm to the victim than their enemy – by focusing their energy on their enemy, the victim has given their abuser “power” over them mentally, since the victim's life is now focused around the abuser. Focusing on revenge can also derail the victim from the they want to lead, separate them from their values, and could lead to doing something rash, reckless, or self-destructive.

I'm curious to hear people's thoughts on whether revenge-seeking behavior is advantageous in an evolutionary sense.  And are there examples of revenge behavior in primates or other social animals?",Are there evolutionary reasons for the desire for revenge?
biology,"So I am working on this assignment where I have to go out in nature, and take a photograph with e.g. my phone camera. Then, explain with the help of the picture how the concepts of cellular respiration, photosynthesis, and organic compounds are connected to each other. Using the picture, I should also be able to explain the carbon cycle. [Here's the image I took](https://imgur.com/a/xIdFovM), and below you will find my answer. Please help me by sharing your thoughts on how I should restructure my text, or if I should elaborate somewhere, etc. thank you in advance:

&gt;Organic compounds consist of molecules that have a carbon skeleton, that is, it has a chain of carbon atoms that form the basis of an organic molecule. Organic substances are high in energy, and some of them are used as fuels, e.g. substances contained in petrol. The molecules consist of carbon and hydrogen, and when these are combusted, during the formation of carbon dioxide, we have a reaction between the carbon atoms and oxygen. The hydrogen atoms in the molecules can also react with oxygen during combustion, and from this, water molecules are formed. Plants are made up of organic substances, and when they burn, carbon dioxide and water vapour are formed. The energy in these is converted into heat and light energy. Humans, and other living things, also consist of organic compounds, such as carbohydrates, protein, and fat. In order for the carbon atoms not to run out in nature, they must be reusable, which is why we have something called the carbon cycle. The cycle contains molecules from carbon dioxide and glucose. Plants can form glucose through photosynthesis, and the carbon atoms needed for glucose are derived from the carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere (air), which is an extremely small proportion, 0.039%.  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to carbon dioxide, plants need water and energy to produce glucose. The plants convert light energy from the sun, or lamps, into the green substance chlorophyll that is found in the plants' leaves, as this is where light energy is collected. During photosynthesis, oxygen is formed, in addition to glucose, and released to the environment. The reaction of photosynthesis can most easily be described according to this formula:  
&gt;  
&gt;light energy + carbon dioxide + water ⟶ glucose + oxygen.  
&gt;  
&gt;Six carbon molecules, and water molecules, together with light energy, gives us an excess of oxygen atoms, which is why oxygen is formed. Thus, the oxygen present in the atmosphere of the planet is formed by photosynthesis. At the same time as photosynthesis is driven by light energy, the energy released during cellular respiration is of a corresponding amount, and is converted into heat, which is then radiated from organisms. Energy has no reuse in a cycle, like carbon, because it radiates from organisms into space. This means that the sun has a great impact on the life that exists on our earth.  
&gt;  
&gt;Glucose are classified as simple sugars, monosaccharides, from which we can derive much of our energy. Humans get glucose, and other energy-rich nutrients, with the food that are eaten.

biology,"Sorry if this is a dumb question. I'm probably missing something easy here, but my understand thus far is at the exon-intron junction is essentially a splice site. If it is the 3' intron or 5' exon end the consensus motif is typically AG|G whereas 3'exon or 5'intron it is AG|GU. So I am assuming this is the pre-mRNA sequence so that would mean the corresponding DNA sequence should be TC|C and TC|CA?

Since common colds are perceived as harmless enough for voluntary infection on cohort studies to be a safe and legal thing to do (British common cold study, circa 1985), I'd guess that perhaps it wouldn't have ever crossed anyone's minds that these viruses could have infections lasting significantly longer than the symptoms themselves. And maybe it would be thought that, even if it could be the case, it wouldn't be really important.

But maybe it is. Perhaps some people who have had some degree of decline in stamina over the years are really affected by secondary symptoms of some cold infections, maybe also flu, I don't know. But everyone would just assume it's really just that they're getting old and their health ""naturally"" declining, or, without that being the effect of a continuous infection.

Is this kind of thing in the realm of possibilities, or is there somehow robust negative evidence against the notion that other cold or flu viruses have in some people long-lasting infections, with a somewhat different set of symptoms?","Was it ever hypothesized that even common-cold Coronaviruses could have long-hauling infections, with reduced symptoms?

biology,"Hey there!

I'm Alain, a PhD student working in the mathematics of Deep Learning.

Recently we've seen this amazing effort from a lot of researchers to move their seminars online. It brings tremendous value to their community, but finding them on the internet is an impossible task. So we built with colleagues and friends a centralized platform designed for academics to post their online seminars in a **more effective and time-saving way,** and to easily browse through other research groups as well.

You might think that this is a temporary solution due to COVID-19, but our vision goes much further than that. Being in world-class institutions, we realize how lucky we are to have access to talks by leading researchers, so we want to share them as broadly as we can. Also, traditional seminars use a lot of resources to invite a speaker on-site to give a short talk. In the era of climate change, we must take responsibility and only travel when is required.

We released the platform very recently and already have more than 50 leading research groups from Oxford, Imperial, Stanford, MIT and all over the world publishing content on a regular basis.

Let's open our universities and share research worldwide! Go check [https://agora.stream](https://agora.stream/)

If our vision resonates with you or if you know anybody this might be useful to, please do spread the word. Feel free reach out to me if you have any questions / feedback.

See you very soon!

biology,"There was a jet airliner that flew way too close behind a jumbo jet. The jumbo jet produced 200 MPH horizontal tornadoes (wake vortices) at its wingtips, which spread out. They hit the other plane at 60-80% of their original strength. This type of turbulence can cause vertical accelerations (up and down bumps) of up to 10 G.

The rotating vortices caused the plane to suddenly jolt sideways, left and right. The (sideways) G loads slowly increased, from 0.3 G sideways to 0.9 G right before the tail fin of the plane broke off causing it to go into a high G flat spin that tore off the engines. The time between the turbulence striking and the vertical tail fin ripping off was about 8 seconds. Vertical loads on the plane before breakup were +2.1 G. The plane was climbing at 2,000 feet when the tail fin snapped off. All 250+ on board died.

**Structure of Cell Wall**

Written by: Shamaun

A cell wall is an outer layer that surrounds certain cells that are located outside the cell membrane. All cells have cell membranes, but generally, only plants, fungi, algae, most bacteria, and archaea have cells with cell walls. The cell wall provides strength and structural support to the cell and can control to some extent which types and concentrations of molecules enter and exit the cell. The materials that make up the cell wall differ according to the type of organism. The cell wall has evolved many times between different groups of organisms. The cell wall has a few different functions. It is flexible but provides strength to the cell, which helps protect it against physical damage. It also shapes the cell and allows the body to maintain a certain shape overall. The cell wall can also provide protection against pathogens such as bacteria that try to invade the cell. The structure of the cell wall allows many small molecules to pass through it, but not larger molecules that could damage the cell. The main component of the plant cell wall is cellulose, a [carbohydrate](https://theshamaunmuntazir.blogspot.com/) that forms long fibers and gives the cell wall rigidity. Cellulose fibers clump together to form bundles called microfibrils. Other important carbohydrates include hemicellulose, pectin, and lignin",Structure Of Cell Wall

biology,"I recently read an article entitled ""***T Lymphocytes and Macrophages, but Not Motile Spermatozoa, Are a Significant Source of Human Immunodeficiency Virus in Semen***"" that discusses how HIV transmission from man to woman occurs. In the article, the author states that the HIV-infected leukocytes present in the semen are one of the main source of transmission of the virus through sexual intercourse.

Different mechanisms by which leukocytes can transmit infection on the mucosal surface were proposed in the article. But what caught my attention and made me curious was the fourth mechanism: ""*Infected leukocytes may migrate directly through intact mucosa. Once in the lamina propria, cells could traverse to draining lymph nodes, releasing free virus or interacting directly with host cells such as dendritic cells*""

Reading this fourth mechanism proposed in the article, I had some interpretations:

1 - The leukocytes present in the semen can be ""internalized"" by the woman. In other words, they managed to get to the lymph node, settled there and interacted with the woman's immune cells.

2 - Leukocytes that reached the lymph node through the lymphatic circulation (most likely). Will they be attacked and killed? Since they are foreign cells to the woman's immune system / body?

3 - If they are not killed when they reach the lymph nodes, will they be able to multiply and establish normally in the woman's immune / circulatory system? Becoming part of her immune system?

4 - If these Leukocytes were not infected, would it make a difference? In the sense that it would be easier for them to stay alive in the woman's lymph nodes. Or would they be killed anyway? Attacked for being foreign cells.

What is the most likely mechanism or immune response of the woman's body in this case? Kill the leukocytes (becoming infected in the process) or tolerate their presence and let them be part of the woman's immune system?

Re: casualties and acceptable loss of life resulting from your NNT (numbers needed to treat) formula. 

I’m one of those casualties, and potentially a victim since I could lose my life, from cancer undiagnosed for years because a surgeon was unwilling to do the medical equivalent of “lancing a boil” near the tip of my breast. As a result, I’m preparing to go in to have my entire breast removed because a surgeon chose not to do a surface excision/lumpectomy or biopsy. 

I can only guess as to why such a simple request would be denied, but a preponderance of evidence suggests that it has to do with the NNT formula you publish and the punishment you inflict on doctors for failure to comply by testing too many samples or doing “unnecessary” procedures. Didn’t radiology catch it? No. And finally getting a biopsy was not easy—since no doctor wants to be sanctioned by insurance companies—only to then find out it’s cancer. 

My life means something to me. Something more than your profit margins. Hmm, profiting off the suffering of others. 

Surely there’s a happy medium between what goes on across most of the country and what goes on in Florida where liberal malpractice laws have created an environment where doctors are allowed higher testing and treatment rates than the rest of the country. Had I been living in Florida the likelihood is that I would not now be facing cancer, loss of my breast, potentially debilitating cancer treatment and loss of my life. The problem would have been excised before becoming cancer and you would be grousing about unnecessary procedures and tests, and lamenting the loss of a few hundred dollars, oblivious to the life and money saved by the procedure. 

I have no need to sue the surgeon who declined to treat me when, although culpable, they are also a victim of their training and you are the party accountable and responsible for medical malpractice in this case and all cases that fall into NNT limbo with catastrophic results. You create the winners (your profits) and losers (of their lives for your profits). 

But you say those numbers are not high enough for you to be bothered with. 

I’m wondering how much money my breast is worth to you, my life, my suffering through cancer treatment? And you wonder why doctors get sued. 

Does the public know that there’s at least one insurance provider in the country opening their own medical school so that they can train doctors by insurance standards, not medical standards, for their hospitals?  It’s bad enough that doctors are trained to treat disease rather than the patient, without robbing the health care system of all its humanity or leaving it to the nurses who cannot treat. 

Are you ready for an open conversation in the media with doctors and patients about your ethics, practices, and treatment of doctors? 

I prefer to not sign my name for several reasons: 1) I value my insurance and am not done with treatment—considering how you punish doctors I don’t want to see what you try to do to me 2) I might be your mother, daughter, wife, sister, grandmother, aunt, cousin, niece, neighbor, lover, coworker, or friend. 3) I’m not the only one who falls in your “do not treat” numbers and I thought you should hear a voice for those people. 4) I value my privacy and now I need to focus on my recovery.

One final note to the readers: Does anyone know how to access the congressional hearing tapes where the female insurance CEO came back to congress with cancer and a new perspective about whether withholding payments was withholding treatment? It would be good to have a link to it here. Was she heard? Will I be? Is anyone out there? Or is my story TL;DR? Do you want something done about this for your mother, daughter, wife, sister, grandmother, aunt, cousin, niece, neighbor, lover, coworker, or friend? Or are you in the “Sorry.

biology,"I just finished my bachelor’s in Biology where I did undergraduate research in cell biology. I really enjoyed research (made me switch out of pre-med) and I’m currently taking a gap year or two to intern at different labs and explore other fields. 

To any grad students in molecular bio, cell bio, genetics or immunology (i.e. the fields I’m considering for my PhD), do you think having knowledge in computational biology or bioinformatics would be helpful for your research? Is there much overlap between your research and the skills of computational bio/bioinformatics? Or is it usually the case that if you need a computational analysis for your research, you simply seek out collaborators? 

I’m considering doing a masters in either one before applying to grad school for a couple of reasons: 
1. During my undergraduate research, I really appreciated the value of coding that could process hundreds of images of cells and get quantitative results in short periods of time. 
2. With increasing job automation, these will likely be useful skills and knowledge to have in the future.

I know the cons of doing masters involve the finances, but I’ll likely be sponsored so this is not a major concern for me. I’m just curious as to whether or not this will be a useful skill to have for my later graduate research and if it is worth dedicating a couple of years to. I have self taught myself a bit of coding with R to process data. I’m not crazy passionate about it, but if it is  very valuable, I wouldn’t mind pursing a masters in the field.

biology,"In first year of university I studied the basic sciences i.e. biology, chemistry, physics, standard calc I and II, with the usual goal of eventually doing research in some subfield of bio. 

However I also enjoyed math a lot, and decided to take the higher-level rigorous math classes meant for first years, while in second year (so I could potentially do a math major). I'm also taking/will take next semester: biochem, organic chem II, physical chem, cell bio, genetics, and physiology. I've found the problem-solving skills and general mathematical mindset that I've picked up while doing these math classes to be immensely useful and have made my science classes a lot easier. This is not meant to be a dig at biology, as I still am in love with this field, but in all honesty my science classes have been much easier than proof-based math (which is nothing like the computational, formulaic math that biology majors usually take), and I can really feel it's because of the rigour and grind the math courses have put me through, after all the second year science classes are supposed to be much more difficult than first year, but I'm finding them to be about the same as first year even though there's much more content and the concepts are harder i.e. I'm uptaking information and understanding it at a much faster rate

Really, **my question is:** will having a rigorous math and physics background benefit me in the future? How useful would having this background be when doing research? I understand that bringing in interdisciplinary viewpoints is good for research as a whole, but I'm more asking how this background would add to my skillset/mindset as a biological researcher.

biology,"Hi, I am working on a home lab experiment where I have to investigate how poison (detergent), or fertilizer, affects garlic roots. For the experiment, I use seven empty spice jars, detergent, fluid plant fertilizer (nutrients), water. I had no milliliter measure for the experiment, but instead, had a measure that was 2/3 teaspoons.

**First, I would mark seven jars, where our jars are listed as:**

1. Jar 1 = water
2. Jar 2 = Detergent 0.5 ml
3. Jar 3 = Detergent 1.0 ml
4. Jar 4 = Detergent 2.0 ml
5. Jar 5 = plant fertilizer 0.5 ml
6. Jar 6 = plant fertilizer 1.0 ml
7. Jar 7 = plant fertilizer 2.0 ml

**Then I pour:**

1. 80 ml of water into jar 1
2. 0.5 ml detergent and 80 ml water into jar 2
3. 1.0 ml Detergent and 80 ml water into jar 3
4. 2.0 ml Detergent and 80 ml of water into jar 4
5. 0.5 ml plant fertilizer and 80 ml of water into jar 5
6. 1.0 ml plant fertilizer and 80 ml of water into jar 6
7. 2.0 ml of plant fertilizer and 80 ml of water into 7

I peeled the clove of garlic for each jar, and made sure that the roots of the garlic remained. I then placed the garlic clove in each jar with the root immersed in the liquid. I made sure that the jars were placed somewhere near a bright window.

Now‚ I will measure the length of the roots, every two days, for at least 10 days. I will measure the length of the roots with a ruler by picking up the garlic clove, and then putting it back. If the water level drops, I add more tap water.

So here are my findings after two days:

1. Fertilizer 0.5ml = 0.7cm
2. Fertilizer 1.0ml = 2.0cm
3. Fertilizer 2.0 ml = 1.0cm
4. Detergent 0.5ml = 0.3cm
5. Detergent 1.0ml = 0.0 cm
6. Detergent 2.0ml = 0.0 cm
7. Water 50ml = 1.0cm

---

So I am just here wondering why the garlic clove that was immersed in water that also contained 1.0ml fertilizer caused the root of the garlic clove to grow to 2.0 cm **faster** than the clove that was immersed in 2.0ml fertilizer? Does my results make any sense to you? Is the reason some of them grew faster because they were cloves of different sizes?",[Grade 12 Biology: Environmental problems] Need help interpreting the results of this lab experiment.

biology,"Hello there,

I have a question regarding the poison Novichok. I am supposed to give a lecture on it in my biology course. My question refers to the possible antidote Atropin and the antidote Pralidoxim. I have read that atropine is used as a competitive antagonist. Does this mean that it competes with acetylcholine molecules for the receptors of the sodium ion channels? And if so, what happens when atropine docks to the receptors? Normally these should not open then, right? Atropine is given as an antidote - so that the influx of sodium ions into the postsynaptic cell can be prevented... As a result, no depolarization takes place, and no more action potentials are transmitted, and the contraction of the muscles stops. Can anyone confirm this? Unfortunately, I can't find any details of how it works exactly. Or does anyone know where I can look? I would be grateful for any help:)

Furthermore, how exactly does the drug Pralidoxim or Oxime work in general? I have read that it is given to reactivate the enzyme acetylcholinesterase blocked by Novichok or to stimulate the production of new acetylcholinersterase. But is not cholinesterase irreversibly damaged or inactivated by the phosphorylation of the serine?

I hope that somebody can enrich me with his knowledge. :) By the way, I have written this with a translator, so it is possible that some technical terms are missing or not correct.",questions regarding Novichok poisoning and possible antidotes

biology,"as we know plants absorb water to the xylem, and by transpiration and cohesion - tension they move upward through the stomata and leave as gas to the outside.

lets assume room is at 25 Celcius.

if i take 2 bowls with the exact amount of water in it, and in one bowl i put a plant and in the other one i put a single Capillary tube - how will the water levels change?

i claim, because the plant is drawing water from the roots and the plant has many xylems, surface area to volume ratio is big and a lot more water will evaporate over time than the bowl with the Capillary tube -  which still loses water level because of vaporation. yet, still, very little changes in the water level.

biology,"Vertebrates: animals of a large group distinguished by the possession of a **backbone or spinal column**, including mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and fishes.

The word fish is very vague referring to a very broad category of water living vertebrates closely related to one another which is why there are three different classes being listed. Jawless fishes have a backbone but don't have a Jaw like all the other vertebrates do and they are also the most ancient class among the vertebrates. The other two classes of fishes are [Cartilaginous fishes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chondrichthyes) (**Chondrichthyes**) and [Bony fishes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteichthyes) (**Osteichthyes**). Cartilaginous fishes like Sharks for example don't have a mineralized skeleton and are made up of cartilage the flexible stuff in your nose tip and ears!

Bony fishes can be split further but I will leave it at that. Bony fishes are more numerous than any other class and Reptilians second that. The biggest difference is that they have a mineralized skeleton while Cartilaginous fishes don't.

Finally, as feathery and warm-blooded as Birds may seem they are grouped under Reptilia because birds are pretty much endothermic reptiles in fact they are modern-day survivors of Dinosaurs.  For this reason, they are included under Reptiles in cladistics but excluded in traditional taxonomy.

Also, I set up the options in a chronological order from most ""ancient"" or having branched off the tree earlier. Let me know there is any confusion or problems with this poll I want to improve it later on thanks!

biology,"Hi!  

I'm no scientist or even a student of biology, but I have a question regarding the extent to which any biologist here is aware of his/her discipline making any concrete claims surrounding what it understands about addiction/substance-abuse that goes beyond the physical/biological responses themselves.  

It seems a very obvious pattern given our overall behaviour as humans, that most of us have an almost innate tendency to gravitate towards attempts at ""shaking off"" our daily and ""normal"" consciousness on a regular basis. Most humans you encounter and ask will tell you that they regularly avail themselves to substances of all different kinds, being anything as innocuous as caffeine, to some of the most potent of psychedelics such as LSD or DMT, the more socially accepted alcohol, or the humble cannabis, et cetera. 

I wonder if biology or any of its surrounding fields, such as neuroscience, has any theories on offer as to why this apparent tendency exists, and is perpetually pursued, despite attempts at social engineering aimed at preventing them? The reason I ask in a biology-thread is because I'm more interested in whether any such claims exist on grounds that do not levitate towards philosophy/speculation?  

Do our bodies somehow seem in physical need of this kind of ""shakeup"", if you will, in order to function/thrive for instance? Sorry if this is a really noob question, but as I said at the beginning of this, I have no scientific training whatsoever, and the question just occurred to me.

Outside of Asia, were in some perhaps intrusive but for sure effective measures have kept Cov-2 at bay, it seems that many a leader in the world has resigned to believing that there no ways acceptable to the public to halt this virus apart from masks (good) forcing institutions to close (not so good), and large scale lockdowns (ouch). I mean I can't even say honestly all will 'believe' in a speedily made vaccine the first day it's announced--it or rather they might have to prove itself for few month before full acceptance, especially those in western countries doubting a russian vaccine.

&amp;#x200B;

But there is much negativity surrounding this virus. So I wanted to share something some might find positive, if they could get their governments to listen (and perhaps it might be translated into languages spoken by those in a country struggling with SARS-Cov-2).

\-----

Shielding measures

First and foremost, anybody who tells you that mask are not effective is full of excrement. They prevent an infectious person from spreading it to someone else. Just setting the record completely straight. There isn't a good way to prevent yourself getting infecting apart from:

1-A vaccine, which isn't here yet, and even there was one or more one they may not necessarily all be trusted due to the speed of production and fact that amount of transparency in vaccine enterprise in general is only about the same as most other medical amenities; given their pan-treating nature they require significant more transparency than average.

2-A spacesuit, or something like a spacesuit but on earth--this would be nearly as effective as a vaccine. The basic premise  that during lockdown you lead in the production of 'earthsuits'--spacesuits for earth that protect you from pandemics--and require that at risk individuals and anyone who lives with an at-risk individuals wear it to at-risk areas. The way to implement this would require an equal number of tiers each of at risk individual and at risk area, with the level of protection equaling the product of how at risk the individual is and how at risk the area is divided by the total number of tiers each have. Have people disinfect the suit when they get home and wallah, we have conquered this murderous virus. It's murderous not to do it when you don't have a cure.

&amp;#x200B;

Non-shielding measures

1-Lockdown: In the short term, very useful as it not only prevents (SARS-Cov-2) death but also deaths from other causes such as traffic accidents. Over very long periods of time, it is absolutely useless as it will destroy the economy to the point were it kills more people from suicides, starvation and rough sleeping than the virus.

2-An effective track and trace system: Modeled by countries Taiwan and South Korea, it is by far the best long term solution taking only the virus and the economy into account. However, as with vaccines, governments that haven't been transparent enough in previous times including peacetimes are yet earn the trust of citizens to the required degree during even this Pandemic War Period (PDP)--an effective program needs an amount of intrusion, too much for to many.

&amp;#x200B;

So now what? Do we throw are hands up in the air and say the apocalypse is nigh? Do we  decide to live in the world of short-term planning and pretend not to see long-term we have no plan? This is essentially what is being done by even those who are accusing others of letting people die by not imposing lockdowns if they say this without a good idea on how to stop the virus when lockdown is left; they are essentially saying, let's kill people through starvation and cancers not diagnosed early when we either never leave lockdown or inevitably enter it again, as it doesn't look as bad on TV.

&amp;#x200B;

Fortunately, there are is the earthsuit idea. Fortunately, for the weirdo minority of people who don't think going outside is a spacesuit everyday as if you were on another planet is the definition of C-O-O-L and should be done even for it's pure epicness, there is a third non-shielding measure: early on in the *pan-demic,* when SARS-Cov-2 started occuring in Japan, former prime minister Shinzo Abe mentioned that . . . 'we must all assume that we have the virus'. On a personal level, this means wear a mask and don't go outside. On a state level, this, combined with mask wearing, is the equivalent of a national lockdown. However, what would be the implications from assuming that you have it 90%? 80%? 70%? I mean obviously, a national lockdown that works on the assumption that very one has the virus is odd because--well, everyone has the virus so essentially all are immune on that assumption and it defeats the point. But on a likelihood lower than 100% . . .

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier I mentioned that different *areas* should be appropriated different risk levels. This should be the core of the pandemowar effort, and I mentioned one branch of the core--shielding people according to how at risk they and the people who live with are--but another branch involves the inverse situation of those asymptotic. So you could say there is really one branch with to forms. One saying that those most at risk should protect themselves, and another saying that those who are least at risk and most likely to spread quarantine themselves. For example, in a system from levels 0 to 4, a normal person might,:

&amp;#x200B;

After visiting a ***4*** area need to quarantine for ***4 weeks***

After visiting a ***3*** area like a restaurant, bar/pub, need to quarantine for ***3 weeks***

After visiting a ***2*** area need to quarantine for ***2 weeks***

After visiting a ***1*** area like a shop or hairdressers or another person's household, need to quarantine for ***1 week***

After visiting a  ***0*** area like the street or an open field, not have to quarantine.

It might be worth reminding that North Korea likeli made sure that every single person who attended the military parade had quarantined for two weeks beforehand. It seems odd that North Korea can implement such a strategy and most other can't find a non-dicatorial everyday alternative--the above--apart from lockdowns.

The actual risk levels would also depend on how busy the area is at the time. A shop may become a ***2*** on Saturdays and a ***0*** on Sundays, and, before noon,  weekdays.

This does means that only those well enough to do could afford to visit higher risk area, but this in fact is far *less* discriminatory than any preceding lockdown that may devastate those living paycheck to paycheck ***before*** SARS-Cov-2.

If both branches are combined, you'd have the safest herd immunity strategy yet, as the only people going to high-risk areas would be the healthy who live with the healthy or no-one. This could work indefinitely even though immunity from SARS-Cov-2 only lasts about half a year.",Lack of creativity in the pandemic-war effort?

So this could be an interesting project. I have in my possession some really pure [shungite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shungite) and have made my own ""shungite water"" essentially by soaking the shungite in water. 

Shortly after I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8nYyb8ixd0) and it surprised me. It appears this person found microorganisms in the water, not sure how long he soaked the water though.

This really astonished me, as shungite is nearly 100% carbon, how could microorganisms live inside and leach out into the water?

I've been soaking my shungite for 4 years now because I haven't been near a microscope to do the experiment. But I would like to take a sample of the water and send it to you for magnification, if you would like to participate in this strange experiment with me.

The lab I worked at when I was in my undergrad had this PhD student. He was a pro trump dude who was extremely annoying. He smiles all the time and talks to everyone every minute in invasive manners. He is unhygienic and unorganized. He literally put ethidium bromide in the microwave and thought it wasn’t a big deal. 

But anyway he didnt cap and balance a large centrifuge once and the thing got out of position, scraped the inside for a longtime and when the timer was done the thing was destroyed. My PI had to write a grant to cover the cost (30k) and was thinking of kicking him off the program. The next thing we know he brought his parents and lawyer (this motherfucker is 25) on campus and threatened to sue the pi. Then he stayed and finished his PhD, and his defense wasn’t even good but my pi was so done with him she just didn’t give a fuck and kicked him out. 

So now when I’m stressed about my program, I tell myself, if a person like him can get a PhD, I don’t have any excuse to give up.

biology,"Some [definitions](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/homeostasis) define homeostasis as:

&gt; the *tendency* for a living thing to maintain a steady internal environment.

So far, so good. Now the part where I get confused is when scientists use the term to refer a self-regulating process. For example, they’ll talk about things [like](https://www.ptglab.com/products/featured-products/ion-homeostasis/) “calcium ion homeostasis” to refer to the regulation of calcium levels. They also talk [about](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/glucose-homeostasis) “glucose homeostasis,” for example.

So it looks like homeostasis is being used in two distinct ways:

- a overall tendency of a living thing’s internal environment to remain steady

- the regulation of a *specific* substance

biology,"I am an aspiring biology educator and greenhorn in the field of game-based learning. Recently I have gotten into fantasy football and am impressed how quickly I was able to pick up on player behaviors, team trends, and matchups. A major challenge of game-based learning is finding the right balance between education and entertainment. I believe that a fantasy manager game along the same lines as fantasy football could be used effectively in a classroom setting to reinforce big picture ideas.

I have pondered about this periodically for the last month and want to reach out to the community for advice. I started by boiling down the key features of a fantasy manager game. What basic ideas make the game work?

* Managers take turns drafting one player at a time to build their roster.
* Player pool is broad enough to allow for a variety of team compositions and meaningful management decisions.
* Players can fill unique positions on a team.
* Team position performance can be scored differently, but points gained contribute to the team total.
* Player performance is measurable, objective, and variable.
* There is a periodic deadline by which player/team performance is assessed and relative success between managers is determined.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

With these things in mind, here is a very simple example game for a hypothetical meteorology course: PA Precipitation.

Managers (students) draft a team of five from a pool of 67 counties in Pennsylvania and lock in their team by the beginning of the week. Counties earn points based on accumulated inches of rainfall or snow. The team with the most points at the end of the week wins. This game incentivizes students to familiarize themselves with the weather patterns and geography of Pennsylvania. That's the general application of something like this.

Biology is incredibly broad. While I currently do not have a specific course to apply this thought experiment, I would love help brainstorming different biology topics/lessons that could be reinforced using a fantasy manager game. I'd love to hear your thoughts. Also, please let me know if there is somewhere else I should be posting this. Thanks!","Creating a ""fantasy manager"" game for biology education"

However, there is lots of evidence to show that the loss of biodiversity will have a significant negative impact on humans.

Do you imagine how deep earthworms can go? According to a new study, at least 1.3 kilometers below the Earth's surface. This is the depth at which scientists discovered the new species, named after the demon Mephistopheles (I bet the worm is more harmless than he is).

The worm is the most deeply lived multicellular organism ever found. Researchers have been looking for underground life for 15 years, focusing on South Africa's ultra-deep mines, which penetrate more than 3 kilometers to the bottom of the Earth.

Several teams of scientists have discovered that life has very deep roots, with single-celled organisms found miles below the surface. Some are truly extreme: a 2008 study found a thriving life 1.61 kilometers below the seabed, surviving temperatures between 60 and 110 degrees Celsius.

However, finding the 0.5mm multicellular organism is a totally different discovery. The worm lives in crevices of rocks filled with liquid, where it feeds on bacteria.

It is a simple tiny organism, alive and capable of asexual reproduction. The researchers managed to get H. mephisto to reproduce in the laboratory, and the species are still happily squirming.

However, I've been watching a lot of wildlife rehab documentaries lately, and noticed that even in circumstances where the animals in question (bats, squirrels, koala bears) are treated like human children by their caretakers and allowed to form bonds, they seem to naturally lose interest in them as they mature and when released, return to the wild without a second thought. This surprised me, as I've watched videos of orphaned otters and foxes being raised for release and their caretakers are not allowed to cuddle them or even speak near them, even if it's not to them, so they don't lose their wariness of humans. They'll even wear elaborate coverings so the animals don't recognize the humans as their parents. But it seems like the animals just naturally lose interest in the humans once they reach a certain age and want to be independent, even without these precautions. They also quickly forget them, as evidenced by a video I watched a hand-reared Koala bear who was treated like a human infant by his caregivers, and sixth months later needed to be rescued again when he was found injured (they identified him by a marking they made when he was brought in) and he was terrified by humans, even the ones who raised him. This has made me wonder if the same thing takes place in the wild where animals are raised by their real parents. Do they generally just take off when they can fend for themselves, never to interact with their families again, or do they need to be driven away by their parents to make room for the next generation?","As wild animals mature from infants to adults, do they naturally lose interest in their parents or do their parents have to drive them off?"

Q1.  Consider a regulated bacterial system consisting of a regulatory gene *R*, an operator O that binds the product of *R*, a promoter *P*, and a structural gene *S* that codes for an easily measurable enzyme activity. The system is **positively** controlled by the product of gene *R* and **inducible** by some metabolite.  Indicate whether production of the S enzyme will be constitutive, inducible, repressible, or undetectable in strains (a) to (d) below. You may include diagrams in your answer. 

(a) in an *R-* mutant lacking the regulatory protein. 

(b) in a P- mutant lacking the promoter *P*.

biology,"I am currently a senior in college  with a Biology BSA degree and unfortunately it took me this long to realize that I don't want to be a doctor or anything along that route. After a lot of self reflection and talking to many career advisors, I decided that I would want to go the business or bioinformatics route. Right now, my plan is to take intro business courses and also some intro comp sci/ comp bio (this one is actually needed for my degree). After taking those classes, I hope to narrow down what I would want to do. Should I like business I will finish off my business minor. Should I like CS, I have found some programs that I could get into after graduating.  And then from there most likely grad school. 

My main question is what types of jobs are there that involve business and biology or jobs that combine biology and computer science? I am just trying to research different jobs so I could see what would be my best fit for my interests and so that I can figure out what I need to do to get into those fields. I am aware that I will need more experience and even schooling to get into these other fields but, right now I just want to know the types of jobs fit my interests and what it would look like to work that job.  By that I mean, for example, say that data scientist in the healthcare industry would be a good fit, would would that job consist of? When searching this stuff online I mostly find answers for what I would need to do to get the job versus what the actual job is (other than a general description). After narrowing that down then, I think it would be easier for me to figure out what I would need to do. Right now, I am more concerned about finding what I want to do rather than what I need to get there. I felt like because I focused so much on what I needed to do to get to be a doctor instead of whether I actually want to be a doctor I ended up in the position I am now. So that is why this time around I want to see what I actually want to do before I actually try to go for it.

However when we go to high pressure space, oxygen partial pressure in the air will be very higher. It makes us oxygen toxicity.

For people who have worked in labs in some capacity, have you ever worked with people who only did the third shift? I guess it really depends on the lab, but I imagine some do need staff working through the night, and perhaps even find it difficult to get staff to fill those roles.

From what I can see in online vacancies, exclusively working the night shift is sometimes possible, but rare. Most advertise daytime roles, or sometimes rotational shifts.

I'm just wondering, for those with some experience of this, did you ever have coworkers who only worked nights? I know it's a fairly unpopular preference, but I find it much easier to work at night than the daytime. I know I'd be limiting myself if I only applied for night shifts (if that's even really feasible), but does it seem like something that's possible (perhaps especially in hospitals?) Or am I aiming for something unreasonable here?

What I wanted to ask is regarding the phenomenon of organisms ""evolving"" without natural selection playing a role and whether that can be described as evolution. For example, our brow ridge used to work somewhat like antlers from what I understand, it was a mark of power. When we became more social as a species the brow ridge in males stopped being selected for and it was eventually diluted in the gene pool when other more socially beneficial traits came along. If I understand this correctly, the individuals with a brow ridge were not selected against per se, it's just that specific trait was diluted among others, like adding water in choccy milk. Is that natural selection, or is it the absence of it? If it's not natural selection since the individuals who possessed that trait were not selected against, could the lack of a brow ridge in modern humans be classified as an evolved trait? I recently developed this pet peeve, since to my understanding there's no longer a natural filter to which individuals survive and which don't, and how that impacts our evolution.

So I'm an undergrad senior who is projected to graduate spring 2021. Before COVID hit, I was on track to receiving a BS in biology with a concentration in microbiology. After the pandemic hit, basically shit hit the fan. Teachers starting pulling back concentration required classes, online work has started to be a pain in the ass, and everything generally lacks structure. This concerns me because I'm graduating so soon and I don't want increased schoolwork and lack of experience to affect future employment opportunities.

That being said, I currently still am on track for a BS, just with a different concentration. However, I've been thinking about switching over to a BA for a number of reasons, most of them involving:

1. Have less credit hours to do
2. Have more time in the research lab that I'm currently an unpaid (but hopefully will be paid in the future!) assistant in
3. No need to stress about taking organic chemistry II or physics II online
4. No need to stress about if this current concentration will offer classes in the spring.

Naturally, she proposed this as a trivia question to me, which I immediately responded ""**Tuatara**!"".  She told me I was incorrect, but I knew I wasn't, and yadda yadda I ended up doing a bit more research and determining while the paper did indicate that the red panda was a sole representative, it most certainly isn't the only example in the natural world.

I'm assuming that any actual researchers who wrote the scientific paper for this development did not make this claim.

biology,"Is it possible for a larger, multicellular animal(mouse-size or larger) to develop a mating strategy similar to that of the Schistosoma Blood Flukes, wherein one partner physically protects, carries, and bodily surrounds the other? For clarity's sake, Schistosoma Blood Flukes have a large crease on the male's body - the ""gynecophoral canal"" - which the female slides into and lives in for the rest of either her life or the male's life, in a functionally monogamous relationship.

Could a mating strategy like this evolve in larger animals?

I personally feel it could possibly evolve out of female-guarding behaviors like the strategies of some iguanas, where the males will cover females with their bodies during times of danger. If the males that did this kept being rewarded for their behavior, it could possibly lead to a situation where males latch onto a female once they hit sexual maturity and just not letting go.

Similarly, the mind is drawn to some species of mountain frog, which dwell in ponds that freeze over for most of the year and thus must spend whatever time not hibernating breeding. I seem to recall reading that some ""couples"" in these species will actually go into hibernation while they are still locked in amplexus, giving them a slight head start over those frogs that sleep singly and thus must find a mate after waking up.

How might this impact sexual selection? Might some males evolve into hulking, functionally bipedal and burly-armed brutes that keep their comparatively tiny mates in a permanent 'bridal carry?'(""you'll never have to walk again, my dear!"") Or change into smaller, spiked, armored 'backpacks' that serve as living shields for their women?

biology,"Hey,

i have some questions that may seem cruel to you but they bother me for a long time and i can't figure them out myself. Philosophy wont answer them because the ""human essence"" is almost not questionable there. What i actually can't understand is why people became so sensitive about ""minorities"" instead to care for a ""healthy population"". This is something that contradicts my understanding of nature. Don't get me wrong, i don't say there is no morality or we shouldn't help each other, but sometimes thoughts pop up in my mind asking questions like - the weak and the sick are more likely to get eaten in nature, why are we humans different? Or if the majority is healthy and opressing a minority (and causing suffering in that, etc.), why should the majority succumb to the minority? I know this may sound very cruel to you but this is really poping up in my mind. I simply can't believe that nature can put the suffering of a few before the health of the majority. To me this seems unnatural and uneconomical, nature strives to avoid such imbalances. I know there are theories about the effects of altruism in evolution, but can they explain my questions? I can imagine that it could be a benefit to include minorities, but is this really viable in every case? If i am deeply honest, i simply can't combine current prevalent moral views with my understanding of nature. I think that nature is not striving to equalize inequalities but for the survival of the fittest and if minorities get opressed, they are not the fittest. If a group or population has the upperhand above antother one, why should the ruling group give its power away, except it gains something more worth in return?

I know one can ask ""who are the fittest"", but i am talking on the social level. Population vs population, group vs group or majority vs minority, the stronger vs the weak (if it comes to masses). Is there even such a thing as ""majority/minority"" in biology? Or is (human-)social biology something completely different? What about animals?

I am sure i am not the first one being bothered by such questions. Can you help me out?","How do ""nature"" (in general or animals) treat ""minorities""?"

biology,"I have a very specific question that my textbook isn't getting into - and apparently, my professor is too busy to answer my emails.

I'm trying to better understand what causes the tropomyosin conformation change in smooth muscles.

I understand that in Skeletal Muscles, the conformational change to tropomyosin is caused by the calcium-troponin binding, which moves the tropomyosin out of the way for myosin to bind.

In smooth, my understanding is calmodulin (CaM)+calcium activates MLCK, which phosphorylates myosin for binding - but I can't seem to answer what is moving tropomyosin.  It seems CaM is operating a second-messenger in this system, and it doesn't seem to be bound to actin, in the same way troponin is....

biology,"I acquired a BA in an area of study somewhat related to biology (urban ecology) but have recently become more seriously interested in biology, but I feel I have none of the actual skills that most biology majors have to get hired in biology positions.

I did take a biology class during my undergrad and did okay but didn't excel or anything.

However I've recently developed a stronger interest in biology because of an interest in mycology and would love to reground myself in biology.

For most people, apes have features that are instantly recognizable, and they group all apes with eachother, but personally I have a hard time identifying as an ape because of my preconceived delusions of grandeur regarding our species. I think this thick line I and many of us have drawn between us and apes (or any other animal) is due to the fact that we can recognize specific facial features of other individuals in our species but specifically the fact that we recognize beauty in the faces and bodies of other individuals in our species but we feel indifferent towards the bodies of other species.

biology,"Hello everyone! Apologies in advance; I have a really odd question, not even sure if this is the right sub for it.

My parents have a sailboat on the Black Sea coast and they told me about a strange thing they found on it. During sailing season, the boat stays moored at the local marina. The cabin remains closed overnight, of course.

My parents’ caps usually hang inside right next to the cabin entrance in such a way that the dark cap covers the white one (both caps face the wall). A few weeks ago, my parents found a fist-sized brown lump sticking really hard to the inside of the dark cap. It was heavy, hard and dry and looked like an imperfect ball of dirt or clay. They threw it away. A week later, they found another lump in the dark cap again, half as big as the first one. They threw that one away too without taking pictures and only asked me about the whole thing later. They only keep the white cap in the cabin now and haven’t found anything similar since.

What do you think? What could have made these lumps?",Please help me figure out what this could be

biology,"According to several websites and forums online (only legitimate sources here, folks), one of the limitations of primate cloning is linked to the process itself. Specifically, the part of the process whereby the DNA held within the egg cell is physically removed in order to replace it with the prime specimen's DNA. While this process works with mice and frogs and whatnot, it doesn't apply to primates since the process of DNA removal from the egg also removes many of the vital proteins needed for early embryonic development.

I will admit, I'm talking out of my ass here. But wouldn't it be feasibly possible to destroy the DNA held within egg cells without removing them physically?

1. When a cell undergoes meiosis, do the resulting daughter cells have the same DNA as the parent cell? If not, how is it different?

I think it absorbs all the other colors and reflects the color it appears? Is that right? I know black absorbs all and white reflects but not sure about the others.

I already know the answers to the first two questions here (hypotonic = swells and hypertonic = shrinks), but am leaving them in for context. I don’t understand why that might not always happen though. 

4.

one of them asked how many movable joint types are there in a limb. most of us chose 4 as there are (gliding, hinge, ball and socket, and saddle) joints in an arm. the teacher then decided to change the correct answer to 3 not counting the ball and socket joint. he said that it is a part of the trunk because it connects the humerus to the scapula and the scapula is a part of the trunk.

The next one is that when we asked him he said that the cervical vertebra that has a pivot joint is also a part of trunk.

another mistake that I had was:

around which of the following is lamellae:

a.haversian canal    b.spongy bone

c.osteocyte     d. a and c

so I chose a because the lamellae surround the Haversian canal and osteocytes are embedded in the protein fibers. ( our textbook says surrounds the Haversian canal and also includes osteocytes) .

Berlitz retells the story of a doomed aircraft, an account he attributes to researcher Robert Coe Gardner. According to Gardner, a military transport plane took off from the San Diego Naval Air Station late one afternoon during the summer of 1939. Several hours later over the Pacific, the plane transmitted a desperate SOS, then fell silent. The stricken aircraft made it back to San Diego and managed an emergency landing.

After touchdown, ground personnel were horrified to discover that 12 of the 13 men on board were dead. The sole survivor-the copilot-died several minutes later. Reportedly, all the bodies exhibited massive, gaping wounds, and the exterior of the craft was badly damaged and torn open in places. It was also soon determined that the pilot and copilot had emptied their pistols at some unknown target. The whole episode was quickly hushed up, and Gardner would not hear of it until 1954.",Are Atmospheric Beasts real?

biology,"hi, 25 year old male here, not sure where to start because i want to keep it succinct but there are certainly a few things im trying to understand more.

i drank moderately to heavily between the ages of 21 and 23

i smoked roughly 20-25 packs of cigarettes total between the ages of 22 and 24

i vaped, i believe moderately, between the ages of 21 and 23

basically, im trying to quantify the damage and understand what if anything can be done about it(certainly im well aware how awful these things are now so no need to coax me out of these behaviors, all have been fully stopped and wont ever happen again).

initially my understanding was that the damage incurred would be temporary. I didnt bother due diligence prior to starting, very stupid i know, and just heard the old phrases of alcohol dehydrates you, smoking causes vasoconstriction and harms collagen.. i figured well ok, at some point those effects will be corrected and you will just return to baseline depending on ur age and natural endogenous collagen production, right? Well, apparently wrong. Now, correct me if im wrong here, but if we ignore the epigenetic component (will be the focal point of this post i think) , my initial assumption would have been correct, yes? Since we experience regular turnover in the extra cellular matrix and all. As i see it, the crux of the matter is that beyond just harming collagen and elastin u already have , vasoconstriction, and dehydration... the big issue here is that smoking in particular (as well as vaping based on 1 study i glanced over) induces epigenetic changes that mess up ur whole line of production (mesenychamal stem cells move into dermis, differentiate into fibroblast cells, then those fibroblasts produce collagen and elastin which make up bulk of ur extra cellular matrix, and also some enzyme is responsible for getting rid of collagen and elastin, i guess when the body deems its time to replace). I read that it makes ur stem cells less efficient in differentiating , and makes ur fibroblast cells less efficient at pumping out collagen and elastin, and even alters the enzyme activity to dispose of those proteins faster than is what u want. Not good.

so, i guess it would be nice to know a few things...

\-is this process reversible? if so, how? beyond obvious cessation of the behaviors that caused it and hoping body fixes it on its own.

\-what is the turnover rate of fibroblasts??? i found that the rate for collagen is around 1 month for someone my age, but struggled to find the answer for the fibroblast cells.

\-i read that retin a also induces epigenetic changes but in the other direction so to speak, lol, and the changes are wanted and positive. Do we have an idea as to the ""strength"" of these changes vs the ones smoking induces?

aside from these concrete questions i prob need help getting a primer on the relevant epigenetic changes and help understanding all of this better. I dont have relevant formal background, never took genetics courses, soo.. am just going off of reading studies and articles i could get my hands on.

would be nice to have some more knowledgable ppl speculate as to the damage done, and what sort of net harm im looking at here. I get this part is a bit silly and no point to it, but i am prob neurotic and my mind tends to think in this manner.. i guess it would also be nice to sort of reconcile this in my mind, like , do we have any idea as to comparing UV exposure vs smoking??? for example, which is worse striclty in terms of skin aging... 25 packs of cigs and some vaping, or lets say 5 years of normal lifestyle (not shut in but also not beach going ) sans any spf or hat wearing?? If we could speculate or even conclude that x years of going sans spf is equal to x cigarettes, i guess id feel a lot more calm to think ok well i will use spf daily now , and assume i probably wouldnt have had i never read about al this, so in the end it will be a wash.. if that makes sense.

also would be great to get better understanding of stem cells. I have read we now have clinics offering dermal stem cell injections where they either take someone elses whartons jelly and use those stem cells to inject into ur facial dermis (ive seen them use needles but i assume micro or nano cannulas like they use in south korea would be superior) or use ur own stem cells from adipose tissue and inject it in. Would this solution be a big deal and permanenet, since i guess the stem cells would differentiate into fibroblasts upon entering the dermis and then do their own division and turnover and such?? My fear with this though is the following... if smoking changes ur stem cells epigenome , what is the point of taking these now ""damaged"" stem cells and putting them in ur face?? seems like whartons jelly makes more sense since they are ""clean"" and ""unharmed"" ? What is the typical rejection rate of these?? I read on the panama stem cell clinic site that it isnt rejected but obviously they r subject to bias and googling it led me to sources saying that it has very low rejection rates but its still not 100 percent. How many fibroblast cells are in ur facial dermis?? Highly costly and weird i know but could u just replace them all with whartons jelly derived stem cells ?? What about taking ur own stem cells out, using crispr to correct the harmful changes smoking did to their epigenomes (can this be done?) and then cloning them, and bam u now have infinite supply of ur own ""clean"" stem cells?? just continue cloning them and cryo preserve them and inject into ur face every x months in perpetuity ?? Could we at some point in the next decade be able to just use crispr to edit the relevant genes in cells to pump out more collagen and elastin? Is this even possible, and how would it work? (i know im going over a ton of stuff and now moving onto crispr which is an entire topic unto itself) . It would require us to be able to use crispr in tons of cells at once which we cant do atm , correct ? However, it could be on the horizon?

clarification and help is greatly appreciated, would be awesome if anyone has backgroudn in these topics and if any geneticists browse here, thanks :)",smoking/epigenome/aging

biology,"Hello all! I’m a student from the UK doing my Welsh Baccalaureate Individual Project. Due to the Blind Watchermaker by Richard Dawkins and the Stanford Behavioural Biology Lectures by Robert Sapolsky, I have been introduced to the concept of punctuated equilibria and I found it amazing. I was really shocked that we weren’t taught much on the subject in school so I wanted to base my individual project on why newer research is not included in education specifications, focussing on the fossil gap. For the project, I have to send out a questionnaire in order to evaluate and assess the data. Preferably, the people that take the survey should have a background in biology (this can range from A-level biology to university degrees). I apologise if some of the questions seem basic but I had to write the questionnaire to allow A-Level students to also answer. I would be very grateful if any redditors see this post and take part in my survey (completely anonymous) or point me in the direction of any relevant research papers. Thank you all for reading! :)

biology,"Hi,

My name is Martin and I have been working on a Tabletop roleplaying game for four years. I know but things progress slowly when you have two toddlers to keep from bouncing into furniture. I am looking for someone vastly more versed in biology, evolution in particular, to help me design plausible alien life. I can't offer much but a mention in writing credits since these kind of projects (and games) is a hard niche market to break into and I have no previous experience. It is 100% free time passion project. So keeping that in mind you would probably be a person who finds this proposal an amusing timesink more than anything else. And. If you happen to be in the hobby you'll of course get the product in how many years it might take to finnish.

An issue I have with a lot of sci fi in this hobby is the aliens if sentient is almost exclusively humanoid or human with a small non intrusive detail like a skin tone or a small horn. If there are other types they are either anthropomorphised mamals or the odd arthropod. The wildlife is often lizardified earth creatures or again arthrophods. Which isn't impossible of course, looking at you convergent evolution, just a little too familiar. I want the unfamilliar and litteraly alien.

I would like someone that enjoys me asking them questions and giving plausible answers then discussing them a bit. Thought experiments. What creatures would be dominant on a world with only water on the surface? What if gravity was much heavier than on earth? What other fluids could they live in? What if every ten years the water shifted with a passing comet revealing the ocean floor and constraining life to smaller pools? What if gravity was very low? What if there was an ice crust above?

Do you think you would enjoy this sort of questions every now and then with no expectation on a timely answer, please send me a PM.

Thank you for your time and I hope I did not break any rules.","Would you be interested in advicing on plausible alien bodytypes, evolutionary outcomes and generally discussing what ifs with a designer of a sci fi TTRPG?"

biology,"I am currently applying to PhD programs and have two solid letters of recommendation, one from the PI who ran my undergrad lab for the last year I was there and a postdoc whose project I contributed heavily to.

For my third recommender, I asked a research scientist who I worked directly with at the lab. He suggested I get the recommendation from the lab's previous PI, who ran the lab during my first year as a student there.

The old PI headed two labs, one in the US and one in China. His office was in another building and I rarely had the chance to meet with him. He was also very short with members of the lab, chewing people out at lab meetings on occasion.

When I needed to ask for something from our old PI, a letter of rec or to request he submit grades, he would ignore them until I send multiple followups, or ask another scientist to remind him.

I worry a letter from him would be generic and possibly delayed to the deadline of my application.

Despite this, I think his recommendation would look very good as he is a former faculty member of one of the programs I am applying to.

After requesting a letter from him, and following up and waiting two weeks, he finally responded to say he would write a letter if I really needed one, but that I should instead get a letter from someone I worked directly with.

So, TL;DR should I get a generic letter from my PhD MD former PI or a scientist I worked with who got a research job straight from undergrad?","For grad school, should I get a letter of rec from my PI who I almost never interacted with, or a scientist I worked extensively with but he only has a BS?"

biology,"I, for the life of me, can not do biochemistry exams. I do not understand biochemistry. 

# Can anyone recommend any studying tips to understanding biochemistry?

 I tried to read the textbook  (too dense and thick). I tried to go to office hours (the professor is a nice person but he really can't explain well). I tried to group study with my entire class (less than 10 people total and everyone seems to hate biochemistry - even those who have chemistry bachelors).

**What is also weird is that I have more chemistry classes than biology classes even though I was a biology major at an engineering school.** 

Biology: Bio 1 and 2, Genetics, Physiology, Neuroscience, Tissue and Protein Engineering \*\^, Cell Biology 1 and 2, Biophysics, and Bioinformatics 

\*\^ In Tissue and Protein Engineering class - I was okay with the molecular basis of tissues like ECM, epithelia, etc. It was only when we got to the protein part that discussed much organic chemistry that I was lost. 

Chemistry: Gen chem 1 and 2, Orgo 1 and 2, Biochem 1 and 2, Computational Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry (lots of experimental techniques in Chemistry), Physical Chemistry.

Then my physics classes: I had quantum physics (which was basically like a theoretical chemistry class. We focused a lot on Hydrogen bonding, schrodinger equations) and Thermodynamics (which was Pchem on steroids with mathematics and physics). 

# I only got an A and enjoyed Pchem/thermodynamics. Every other chemistry class, I got a B or C in. 

**So I had about 11 chemistry classes (both on the experimental and theoretical side) for my undergrad, and I had 10 biology classes even though I was a biology major.** 

**Yet, I still do not understand or enjoy graduate level Biochemistry.** 

**What is weird is that I understand molecular and cell biology which is like biochemistry's cousin.** 

Example: For something like apoptosis, I can understand the molecular pathways leading to apoptosis. I know about the molecules - intrinsic pathway - Bcl2 releases cytochrome C which activates Apaf1 which binds to CARD which allows procaspases to form apoptosome leading to initiator caspase to activate executioner caspase which leads to CAD and DNA fragments. 

***This idea of putting things into cascades is borrowed from chemistry.*** Yet when it's a chemical pathway or a cascade with proteins and chemical structures - I'm lost. \[**When it's an enzyme in a molecular biology class, I can understand**. When it's an enzyme or protein in chemistry/biochemistry, I don't understand it\].

&amp;#x200B;

Even when the topics overlap in molecular biology and biochemistry, I don't understand the biochemistry:

1. When we studied the cell cycle in depth with the Cdks (cyclin dependent kinases), I was able to understand it. When we learnt about which biological molecules activated replication, transcription, and translation, it was easy for me. 
2. Then in biochemistry class, I was lost in Mg2+ ions making it more nucleophilic for dNTP. Which proteins and complexes were responsible for the initiation, elongation, termination and differences in translation/transcription in prokaryotes and eukaryotes \[this is ironic since it can be heavily studied in cell biology too\]. Yet I don't get it. 

&amp;#x200B;

My cell biology and molecular biology classes are more engaging. We have 6 professors who do rotations and different lectures. They are usually 50 powerpoint slides. 

In biochemistry, it's also the same format: 8 professors giving lectures in biochemistry. Except most of the lectures are 100 slides long. Each lecture all goes back to the initial lesson at the beginning. If it's a transcription lecture, every single pathway, cascade, etc will go back to transcription. 

&amp;#x200B;

It's so confusing. No one in my class likes biochemistry. My class has 3 chemists and 4 biologist. Yet everyone hates biochemistry even though it's required for everyone. The exams are all tricky. Everyone loves cell biology even the chemistry masters and PhDs.

biology,"Hello. I have an assignment about bioluminescent algae. I need to research how well they can survive under different temperatures. For my research, I have to do a lab test and I need to come up with it on my own. I've come up with this so far:

*""I put the algae on a petri dish with the necessary nutrients and water. This petri dish remains at room temperature and is the control group. On other petri dishes I also put algae with the necessary nutrients and water. In these petri dishes, the surrounding temperature is less than or greater than room temperature. Aside from temperature, all other factors remain constant. This research allows me to see how well the algae can withstand temperature changes.""*

The problem I have, is that I need to somehow be able to determine how many of the algae are alive/how many are dead. I was thinking about indicators, or measuring light differences, but I can't find much about this on the Internet. I need to have a metric for the survivability of the algae to different temperatures. Does anybody know how to determine differences? Cause I'm really stuck here. Also, any new insights about bioluminescent algae are welcome, and so are other lab test suggestions.",Bioluminescent algae survivability

biology,"Hi, I found this video interesting and would love some feedback from the hivemind.

Hameroff is proposing that 

a.) Consciousness resides in microtubulues, not necessarily the brain, which explains why organisms without brains, like bacteria and plants, can make decisions that keep them alive. 

b.) The driver of the origin of life was pleasure, not a drive to reproduce - Our pleasure chemicals are oily in nature, and oil aggregates into protocells, which can develop into cells with metabolism that do not necessarily have a drive to reproduce.

Enjoy and feel free to tell me this is a totally crackpot theory! Fun to think about nonetheless.

biology," Hi everyone,

I'm currently an undergrad student about to graduate this coming spring with a Cell &amp; Molecular Biology degree. Because of the way my university schedule works, I've been involved in 3 six-month full-time internships during the course of my undergrad education (which comes out to be five years total). I've been working in the biotech industry on a team that works to improve viral vectors for gene therapy since July.

One of the reasons I was and am attracted to science is a strong natural curiosity about the way that things work and how we can use that knowledge to solve problems, but I have found it difficult to engage in scientific discussion with my boss or team. I can execute experiments well, and the brainstorming and ideas behind them make sense to me, but I find it difficult to contribute or come up with my own ideas. I have been thinking of pursuing a PhD after a couple of years in industry, but I am second-guessing my ability to think scientifically and ask my own questions!

I love animals and I wanted to help them, to save their natural habitats but recently, I've just totally lost interest in the study of ecology and conservation. I feel bad, and I feel like I have an obligation to study ecology because I dont want to see this planet ruined, but I find other aspects of biology so much more interesting now and have become bored of the idea of studying ecology at university next year. 

Subsequently, I think I'll ask to transfer to another degree course, but I feel like I've let the planet down in a way and I have a kind of guilty conscience. Am I being silly or is this understandable?

biology,"Hey guys!
So, I’ve been reading about horseshoe crabs for fun and I had some questions. 

Firstly, are there different type of endotoxins? To my understanding endotoxins are LPS (lipopolysaccharide) found only on gram negative bacteria. So why do we use LAL if we can use the gram staining method to detect between Gram - and gram + ?

Can we detect endotoxins using gram staining..? 

Secondly, if there is an alternative to LAL called Recombinant factor C (rFC) assay how come some pharmaceutical companies still use the horseshoe crabs blood? It was mentioned in the news that the alternative method is not reliable, how so? 

Can anyone explain the process of using LAL during endotoxins testing? I read that it is longer than using Recombinant factor C and I found a diagram but I can’t make sense of it. The diagram shows the enzymatic step of LAL and RfC. 

Thirdly, when they say that horseshoe crabs are important for the ecosystem , I know they’re important for shorebirds but is there anything else that these arachnids contribute towards?

why is there LAL and TAL? Do they work differently or are they the same thing but just blood from a different species of horseshoe crab?

Finally, from the 4 species are they all nearly threatened or are some endangered? What else is killing these creatures? I saw that if they flip over you should help them flip back otherwise they could die (guessing this is because the sun dries them out/dehydration)
 however they have a tail that helps them to flip over so how come some still can’t?

Sorry about all the questions, I’m just interested in learning more about these creatures since they’re so fascinating. 

Thank you!",Horseshoe Crab Questions..
biology,,Creating Hallucinations Without Any Drugs Is Actually Surprisingly Easy
biology,"I am one not usually known for having a grate understanding of the human body, that's partly why I have come here. But what I do know about us humans, is that we are relatively fragile compared to other species. And that one of the many hurdles we must face each day, is trying not to get electrocuted by our front door.

**Some Backstory.**

So, I'm currently in the middle of creating a ""Thor like"" character for reasons I won't get into. And I wanted to spice things up a bit by trying to add a little plausibility to my madness. And don't expect 100% realism either, were hear to have fun.

The character follows your typical Marvel trope of being turned into a ""super soldier"" through genetic modification. However the ""super soldier serum"" is more akin to the likes of the ""Mutagen"" from TMNT. Which means that any external contaminants may effect the genetic modification. Except not in a extremely horrific way, like the show. But of course something bad happens and the character is electrocuted with an absurd amount of, well... electricity.

What I want to know, is with the increased strength, the increased stamina, the faster healing and all the benefits of becoming a ""super soldier"". Would the electricity straight up kill him, or would it force his body to adapt to the new danger?. Basically becoming Thor.

**My Research.**

I have done a little bit of research and found out that.

**1:** Our cells are specialized to conduct electrical currents. And the elements in our bodies, like sodium, potassium, calcium, and magnesium, have a specific electrical charge. Most of this plays into the functionality of your hart.

**2:**  When at rest, the average human produces around 100 watts of power every few minutes. And  some humans can output over 2,000 watts when sprinting. However doing so for long periods of time is obviously harmful.

**3:** Most humans can comfortably sustain around 300-400 watts without hurting themselves, will die if you zap them with 240 volts of power but somehow survive a 10,000 volt zap from a car door. Probably because of ""the path of least resistance"".

And this video shows one of many ways humans can produce electricity: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTDb54RKuCw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTDb54RKuCw)

**My Thoughts.**

It requires at lot more research, but I'm guessing a forced evolution through genetic modification would allow someone to control or even output large quantities of energy,  kind of like an electric eel, or knifefish, as apparently an electric eel is not an actual eel.

Idk, I'd love to see your thoughts on this subject as well.",Electricity and The Human Body (Not as educational as it sounds)

Recently I was able to go through the data about the coronavirus deaths with her and show her it actually is a big deal using statistics and graphs, and contrasted the information to the misleading headlines her family shows her.

biology,"I am a bit confused in regards to a neuron's membrane potential (i.e. the voltage across a neuron), and how it is measured - I have 2 assumptions of how a neuron's membrane potential is measured:

1) Do we measure a neuron's membrane potential solely by measuring (comparing) only the ions that intimately line up the neuron's membrane?

So, for example, putting one electrode of a voltmeter in the inner side of the neuron's membrane, and one electrode in the outside of the neuron's membrane, and then getting the voltage readout for the neuron's membrane potential?

2) Option two is - do we measure a neuron's membrane potential in a ""broader way"" -  meaning that we have one electrode in the neuron's cytoplasm (not specifically in the inner side of the neuron's membrane like in option 1), and the other electrode in the extracellular space of the neuron, again, not specifically putting it in the outer side of the neuron's membrane, but rather more freely, somewhere outside the cell.

\*In both cases I assume that the two electrodes are going to be on the same line, i.e. directly parallel to each other (""looking"" at each other across the neuron's membrane).

I'm asking this question because I know that an influx of ions (for example sodium ions) would cause a depolarization of the membrane, which seems to indicate that a neuron's membrane potential is measured as suggested in option 2, where an influx of ions INSIDE the neuron's cytoplasm would cause the depolarization - because that influx of ions is not constrained only to the membrane itself. 

However, it can also mean that the influx of ions into the cytoplasm can cause the ions that intimately line up the neuron's membrane to diffuse away from the cytoplasm (due to electrical repulsion and attraction caused by the flux of ions), thereby causing the neuron's membrane to depolarize? In this case, this scenario is consistent with how we measure the voltage across the neuron in option 1.

 I've done some reading and it seems the redness of the plant does not seem to affect the amount of light absorbed too drastically which gives me hope that the recombination of such genes would still produce a viable plant.

biology,"So I moved into a residence in Feb, and right outside my window there are these four deciduous trees.

When I moved here, all four of them were full of bright green leaves. As Autumn came about (Southern Hemisphere), their leaves began browning and falling, however I noticed that the tree closest to the building began this period first, with the tree farthest from the building browning significantly later, creating a sort of gradient. This pattern occurred when the leaves fell in late autumn too, with the close tree having no leaves whereas the far one still had a full set of brown/red/orange leaves.

As spring came about, flowers began blooming in the 3 close trees, whereas the far tree still had nothing. These flowers were super delicate, and we had about 2 weeks straight of very strong wind which took off all of the petals, leaving the trees essentially barren.

It’s now summer, and the 3 close trees are all fully green again, and have been for about a week. However, the far tree is instead full of beautiful small pink flowers. It has bloomed so late that it missed the entire 2 week period of strong winds, so it still has all its flowers and now has some young green leaves beginning to show, whereas the other 3 trees have dense, fully grown leaves.

Is there an explanation for this? I found it super interesting watching this over the year. All the trees are in a sort of zigzag line, spaced pretty evenly apart and I’m pretty sure they’re all the same species, however the far one does seem quite a bit smaller.

biology,"Hi, just to start the post by saying I’m not sure if this is being posted in the right place, I struggled to find a forum for this type of question. I am a layman about most of this stuff, but I figured this was the right place to ask. 
	
I have been looking at hair glues (adhesives used to attach non surgical hair replacement systems to ones head), and researching the toxicity of some of the glues. We (have been discussing it on a hair loss forum) came to the conclusion that a brand called “ghost bond” was probably the safest, as it is water based not acrylic based. Having read the MSDS sheet for it however, it apparently contains “Acrylate/Copolymer-dispersion” or “Chemical characterisation (substance): Dispersion of acrylic polymers in water.” (listed differently for different products). Having researched this a bit, I found out this in itself probably isn’t harmful, however the monomers used to create it are, and some can be left over after the polymer is produced. I found a study that mentioned this (https://www.researchgate.net/publication/10941612_Final_Report_on_the_Safety_Assessment_of_Acrylates_Copolymer_and_33_Related_Cosmetic_Ingredients) found this exact text block on multiple sites, not sure if there is an original study available for free. 

Based on this, and the usage of hair adhesive, I have a few questions about the possible implications of this in regard to health: 

1.	Would it be likely that applying an adhesive (which according to the study can be in concentrations of 25% of the polymer in glues), potentially could pose a risk, considering the fact the hair system is re-applied with the adhesive once or twice a week? 
2.	I have heard that most of the absorption of chemicals from substances placed on the skin happens in the first few minutes, and that once the glue has set then there is no more absorption. However as this glue is water based it can sometimes “re-liquify” (not to the original extent, but it can go from solid to “a gooey mess” (direct quote from people who have used it). Would this “gooey mess” potentially mean more chemicals can be absorbed? 
3.	How applicable are studies like this to humans? They are done on mice, is there a possibility that the chemicals could be much more carcinogenic to humans and therefore be dangerous at lower concentrations? 
4.	Why is the amount that is dangerous quoted in terms of concentration? Is the volume not also important? 
5.	If the chemical is dangerous at x concentration, how some it isn’t dangerous at all concentrations? Is it something to do with the liver flushing the chemicals out of the body? 
6.	If the chemicals are carcinogenic, is there anyway to know how carcinogenic they are (i.e. do they increase your risk 40%, 400% or 4000%)? 
I appreciate any and all help with this, we have been discussing it on another forum for a while but I figure some more specific insight could be helpful.

1: proffeisionell antigen presenting cells dendritic or macrophages obtain a pathogenic antigen through pinocytosis or phagocytosis respectively. Intracellularly they break down engulfed proteins and present a peptide segment of this protein on their MHC2. Here is what I cant understand about this. First, how does the cell know which protein to use as the antigen to represent. If you consider the effects of antibodies, the antigen needs to be a peptide on the surface of its pathogen that the antibody binds to for inducing phagocytosis or complement system.   Alternatively it needs to be something like a toxin that the antibody can neutralize. I mean if the antigen is from a protein active intracellularly of the pathogen, the antibody would be completely useless since it would never be able to bind to it unless magically taken up by the bacteria. So unless the antigen presenting cell has a system for the antigen it chooses, our immune needs a lot of luck that a suitable one is chosen.
Secondly: if i understand correctly, antigens presented are only a peptide segment from a broken down pathogenic protein, not the whole thing itself. Now given proteins structural properties, the way they are folded, a segment of it would have very different structural properties from the collective. Doesnt this mean that the antibody may bind great to the segment, but the whole protein on lets say a bacteria, would have a different affinity.

2: b cells have great variation for their antibody potential which is great for being able to combat every specific possible thing, but given our super specific system with at least 10^11 different possibility for every possible antigen, we would need so many b cells with every type of specificity so the cell would actually have a realistic possibility of beinh presented with an antigen it is specific too.

So, I understand the evolutionary advantages for us to follow a 24hr(ish) circadian rhythm that involves us waking up in the morning - this would have allowed our ancestors to make the most of daylight for foraging, travelling, etc.

Now, I'm incredibly curious about whether there's anything inherently wrong with a long-term shift in the phase of your circadian clock. i.e. Us looking at blue light screens until late and sleeping from **3am - 11am**.

Assuming that that routine doesn't necessarily harm someone's ability to exercise/find food in this modern paradigm, would someone who followed this pattern for a lifetime be at a higher risk for disease/inflammation/problems than someone who sleeps from **11pm - 7am**?

I am assuming yes, and that the quality of sleep of the latter will somehow be deeper and better. But, my question is, why?

Secondly, if the second law of thermodynamics states that energy transfer or transformation increases the entropy of the universe, then how does a spontaneous process not have an input of energy?

I used a commercial ELISA kit to run serum samples.

I used repeater multi-channel pippetman, and ran everything myself.  

I fought to run everything in duplicate, (except my high and low controls which ended up as one of each per plate), even though the expert was very confident in the kits. I was told that everything was turning out perfect due to R\^2 values of 0.99 to 1.0, and I plowed forward.  

When I started reading other literature, I learned about and inter assay and intra assay CVs and it's not good (47.7% and 8 to 23.8%).  I reran a few samples that had high individual CVs, and they often were different from the original run.

The intra assay variability of the serial dilutions was 1.4 to 5.4 %, which, granted, isn't something I was supposed to calculate, but I wanted to see if those went as poorly.

So how does this happen?    
I feel like the CVs of the standards implies that my pipetting wasn't atrocious?  
I'm leaning towards sample mixing issues?  Cells or other inconsistencies in the serum that could cause some variability in binding?

biology,"I live in a suburban area bordering a lot of woodland. The squirrels near me are big, and not very friendly. They run at the slightest hint of a person walking near them, and overall, they behave very differently than the ones found in the city near me. 

Squirrels in Boston, MA, are much smaller than their ""wild"" cousins, and don't seem to be afraid of humans as much. They'll come up to you if you're eating hoping to get some food, get right up to your feet, and even grab food out of your hands. If you're staring at them while they beg, they'll do little tricks, like stand on their hind legs and put their hands together, or do little hops until you give them food. I saw a homeless man petting them too. 

Am I correct in assuming that these squirrels are on the road towards domestication, or already domesticated? This scenario seems similar to the way cats were domesticated. By living alongside humans and getting used to their presence over time, as well as depending on them as a food source. These city squirrels have been in close proximity with humans for generations, and depend on us as a food source. Their behaviours are very different than wild squirrels, and compared to their wild cousins, they aren't afraid of us at all. 

Are there any ways we can study this? Either via searching for genetic markets associated with domestication, or taking wild gray squirrels, and city gray squirrels, and raising them as pets. Then, study how their behaviours differ as they grow up. 

I have a hypothesis that city squirrels would make better pets than wild squirrels due to the fact that they've been in the domestication process for years. They're also much smaller which makes them a more suitable house pet.",City Squirrel Self Domestication?

''Research from Tel Aviv University comparing cellphone mobility data and COVID-19 mortality data released on Tuesday could have far-reaching policy implications, since it seems to show timely social distancing rather than the severity of lockdown restrictions is the key factor in reducing the spread of and mortality from the coronavirus.

***The peer-reviewed paper, which was accepted for publication in EMBO Molecular Medicine***, compared data collected from the cellphones of iPhone users (Apple Mobility Data) to COVID-19 mortality data and found that the date on which social distancing began in different OECD countries is the best predictor of the mortality rate relative to the size of the population – with a delay of 7.49 days doubling the number of fatalities. In contrast, ***no statistical correlation was found between the number of fatalities and the duration, severity or even total lack of a lockdown in each country***.

The study was conducted by Prof. Tal Pupko, head of the Shmunis School of Biomedicine and Cancer Research, in collaboration with Prof. Itay Mayrose and research students Gil Loewenthal, Shiran Abadi, Oren Avram, Keren Halabi, Noa Ecker and Nathan Nagar of TAU’s Faculty of Life Sciences.

“Mobility data indicate that a hermetic lockdown, in which everyone must stay at home, is unnecessary. Instead, social distancing measures should be introduced as early as possible,” say Pupko and Mayrose. “We have shown that the countries with the lowest mortality rates in the first outbreak of COVID-19 were not those that imposed the most hermetic lockdowns, but rather those in which mobility decreased (even slightly) at an early stage... as the government considers tightening [Israel’s second lockdown] even further, the import of our research is clear: Extreme restrictions are uncalled for. What we need is fast implementation of social distancing.”

In their study, the researchers collected cellular data that reflected the extent of mobility on a specific day in each OECD country, then normalized the data to the size of the population and typical mobility patterns in that country. For example, in wintertime, people in cold countries like Sweden don’t go out as much as people in Israel. The researchers obtained a mobility indicator for every country in regular times: the average number of citizens who travel by vehicle every day. Starting in March 2020, they found a decrease in mobility in all countries. However, this reduction varies from one country to another in accordance with the steps taken, from social distancing in Sweden, to hermetic lockdowns in countries like Italy, Spain and Israel.

Researchers Avram, Abadi and Loewenthal elaborated: ”We would have expected to see fewer COVID-19 fatalities in countries with a tighter lockdown, but the data reveal that this is not the case. This means that Israel could have reached the same mortality rate with a lockdown that was less economically and socially lethal – in the first round and probably in the present outbreak as well.”

The mobility data indicate, for example, that both the time it took to respond to the pandemic and the severity of the lockdown were similar in Israel and in the Czech Republic. And even though Israel’s lockdown was longer — manifested in lower mobility for a longer period of time — the ultimate mortality rates remained similar. In another example, the Spanish lockdown was longer and tighter than the French, but when it ended, mortality rates in both countries were about the same.

“We found that an early implementation of social distancing is the most significant factor, with a very high correlation to the mortality rate,” said the researchers. “Countries that responded quickly with social distancing measures – not necessarily with a tight lockdown – ultimately emerged from the first outbreak with better results. ***In contrast, no correlation was found between mortality data and the severity and/or length of the lockdown.*** Even in Sweden, a country that never imposed a lockdown, we can see that the early decrease in mobility, starting in March, was manifested in the mortality rate. Our study is based purely on observations and does not relate to the premises of any existing epidemiological model. We show that the spread of the pandemic can be prevented by quickly implementing basic measures of social distancing – without a rigorous lockdown.”","Tel Aviv University Study: ''no statistical correlation was found between the number of fatalities and the duration, severity or even total lack of a lockdown in each country.''

biology,"Hello all! I'm a graduate student presenting a paper next week that is central to my thesis, and just want to make sure I have this pathway down pat. Please feel free to correct anything I have wrong - it would be greatly appreciated. I'm looking at the PI3K/Akt pathway of eNOS activation in endothelial cells.

So... there are a number of stimuli that can activate PI3K in the endothelium, whether it be due to shear stress, histamine, bradykinin, etc. - there is a whole host of stimuli that can activate it. Whatever the stimulus may be, activation of PI3K will cause downstream activation of Akt (aka protein kinase B). Akt can then phosphorylate eNOS at a number of motifs (though I'm primarily concerned with Ser1177). This activated eNOS can then oxidize a guanidine nitrogen of L-arginine, releasing nitric oxide (NO) and citrulline as a by-product. This NO can then diffuse into the tunica media layer and enter a smooth muscle cell, and bind to a heme group of soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC), activating it and converting GTP to cGMP. cGMP can then activate protein kinase G (PKG), which leads to activation of myosin phosphatase, which releases intracellular calcium stores - yielding vasorelaxation.

How does this sound? Thank you all - I really appreciate you!",PI3K/Akt pathway - help to clarify please?

I decided to be a bio major because I was interested in doing field research and stuff like that, but frankly this class makes me feel like the subject is just a bunch of memorization. None of the information feels valuable, and there is nothing that is conceptually hard, making it feel like a big waste of time. There is a reason that bio is notorious for being a braindead STEM major when compared to things like physics, math and engineering.

biology,"Hey guys, I love biology and definitely want to do a biology degree at university. I'm very interested in physiology,  so homeostasis, osmoregulation, the endocrine and nervous systems, as well as organ systems and organ/body functions. The thing is, physiology only seems to have a good amount of application when grouped with anatomy, which is obviously a core component of medical school. So, I was wondering if any of you have experience or knowledge of where a degree involved in animal physiology has a good amount of application other than in veterinary science?

 I'm currently considering a degree in animal behaviour, which has modules that include physiology, animal ecophysiology, wildlife disease, animal cognition, and sensory ecology.

biology,"Hello everyone! 

I am currently studying to be a biochemist and I have engulfed myself in the sciences for many many years. I love it to death, and I take in a lot of different forms of media relating to it. So it only made me more puzzled when my philosophy teacher told me that I had misconceptions about evolution. We were arguing about the existence of God, and he said something along the lines of “Nature does not have the ability to create complexity on its own, therefore some sort of original creator must exist in order to create such complexity”. I instantly thought about how evolution and natural selection is able to create such complex organisms and environments, and I proposed this to him. He then said “that is what you get wrong about evolution and natural selection, you only see what it results in when in fact they both LIMIT complexity by design.”, he then told me that “Ancestor organisms had more DNA, and natural selection and evolution both decreased it”. He also told me that “natural selection and evolution shouldn’t work because the rate at which organisms need to evolve to survive is too slow, and the traits cannot be targeted quick enough for the species to survive” essentially telling me he does not believe in evolution. 

I suppose all of this just had me taken back a bit as I have never had a professor tell me I had misconceptions about ideas that I was taught by his own colleagues in years previous. 

Can anyone comment on what he was talking about? He also says quite a lot of other things of the sort, but I figured it was far too long already.",Any truth to my philosophy teachers claims?

1. I’ll ascertain the effect of drought on plant species of different wood density (WD) in a mountainous tropical forest. So I’ll be comparing the data of mortality pre-drought to the one post-drought and also checking out regeneration rates post-drought (so I’m not analysing only one census).
2. Possibly, but this depends on my time, I’ll also investigate a correlation between height (as in, canopy and undergrowth species) and WD. As in, taller species having significantly different WD from shorter ones.
3. If there is a difference, I'd like to do that as a stepping stone to analyse mortality rates in canopy and undergrowth species within each WD class, all separately, and investigate if there's significant difference between these two height groups.

 I have the tabular data for the censuses, so I can calculate the mortality rates and regeneration rates and what not. Once I have them, though, that's where the trouble begins.

 I'm thinking 1 asks for a simple linear regression? Although if you ask for my dependent variable I'll have to think a little.

 As for 2, a T-test (I've read about Pearson Correlation, does it yield a similar analysis?).

 And since 3 has many subgropus I'm thinking of a Nested ANOVA. But my knowledge of this method comes from reading papers. I am not acquainted with nested models.

biology,"Hey everybody. So what I’m about to say is essentially considered “blasphemy” in the medical field. There is a certain neurotransmitter in our bodies that is at the center of all Pathophysiological processes, and it is referred to as Anandamide. The thing about Anandamide is that it is involved in every single system of the body...it is quite literally keeping you alive at the current moment. This neurotransmitter is produced in the Nucleus Accumbens, or the Pleasure center of the brain. It is at the center of Endocrinology, Immunology, Neurology, and Psychiatry. This information is all on the Internet, and I highly encourage any medical professionals who are reading this to look it up. There are reports of a woman in Scotland, I believe, who has a genetic disorder that causes increased Anandamide levels in her body. The effect is that she simply doesn’t feel fear or pain the same way as other people. I recently attempted to replicate this effect with drugs as a treatment for my psychological and physiological illnesses, all of which are Chronic. The results have been similar to the symptoms of this Woman’s, and in addition each of my illnesses has gone into remission. I am going to explain how I have been able to do this, but first I want to say that everyone needs to be careful with this information. I am not actively advising anyone to do what I've done, I'm simply explaining the concepts behind it and giving warnings about potential improper usage. There seems to be no evidence of any contraindication. All evidence points to this treatment being extremely beneficial, but I do not know this to be objectively true. To many people this would be terrifying, but to someone like me this is very exciting.

The Anandamide Project revolves around the highly complicated processes of many systems. These include the TRPV receptors(heat receptors), the TRPM receptors(cold receptors), the Serotonergic system, and of course the Endocannabinoid system. Each of these is vital in the correct functioning of our bodies, and each is influenced heavily by Anadamide. For example, Anandamide activates the main TRPV1 receptor in the Hypothalamus to lower body heat. Anandamide is also key in the functions of the Endocannabinoid system, an extremely new system that is completely ignored by the Medical community. The simple fact is that this system plays extremely significant roles in many vital processes, including Inflammation, Homeostasis, Metabolism, and Stress response. The Serotonergic system is also regulated by CB1 receptors, or receptors in the brain that seem to be responsible for feeling pain. This is extremely significant because the Serotonergic system is involved in the modulation of numerous Neurotransmitters other than Serotonin, including Dopamine, Epinephrine, Glutamate, Cortisol, Epinephrine, Norepinephrine, and Acetylcholine. Meanwhile, CB2 receptors in the Peripheral nervous system play the role of responding to the stimulus of feeling pain by initiating the actions of Prostaglandins. Anandamide also mediates Long Term Potentiation and Depression, or the formation and destruction of memories in the brain. The thing that makes Anandamide stand out is that it simply can’t be stored in our bodies, we have a limited supply of it and only make it when we are happy. This is just the tip of the Iceberg when it comes to all of it’s activities, but put simply it seems that the more Anandamide we have the less likely we are to get sick with Autoimmune, Psychiatric, or Oncological diseases. With this being said, there are easy ways for those of us who already have them to boost our Anandamide levels. The result of this is decreased pain and inflammation.

The easiest and safest way to get your Anandamide levels up is simply by exercising. This is the reason we get a “runner’s high.’’ The benefits of Physical exercise seem to be the best protection we have against free radicals, and this is the only treatment that many people need. If you consider yourself a Scientific mind you know that a study with one subject is not reliable, so please use caution when it comes to what I’m about to say. Tylenol is an Anandamide reuptake inhibitor, meaning it boosts the levels of Anandamide in the body. This also in turn activates the main Heat receptor to lower body temperature. Whatever you put in your body after taking Tylenol will have a stronger effect. A great example of this is the drug Percocet, a mix of Vicodin and Tylenol that is extremely addictive. Tylenol seems to have the potential to be both extremely beneficial when used correctly and extremely dangerous when used incorrectly. The activity of increasing Anandamide seems to be very beneficial, but this drug is also Hepatotoxic. It is simply not good for your Liver, and I don’t recommend anybody take it regularly without a very good reason. I can promise that anyone who takes Tylenol with another addictive drug inappropriately simply won’t live long, so I’m imploring everyone to please be responsible with themselves and consider how whoever finds their body would feel in that moment. I have found the effects of moderate Tylenol use to be extremely beneficial for my own Diseases, but that is just my subjective experience.

The second strategy that I have been using is taking Menthol/Mint. This may surprise many people, but the reason we add Menthol to cough drops is because it acts on the main cold receptor in the Hypothalamus, TRPM8, to lower body temperature. This is very significant because lowering the body temperature seems to decrease stress and inflammation. I have found this to be very effective in treating my own anxiety. I used to be very prone to “overheating” in times of stress, but it has been about a month since I have had to deal with this symptom. I’m not sure if this one actually increases Anandamide, but regardless it is very useful for those with inflammatory diseases. Everyone should also remember that I take these drugs with Tylenol, so all the effects are enhanced.

The third ingredient is Cannabidiol. This drug is in a class referred to as Phytocannabinoids, and these of course are taken from the Cannabis plant. The whole reason that they exist naturally in the Cannabis plant is as a very advanced defense system against free radicals. This fact is actually the origin of this whole idea, as I simply drew the conclusion that Anandamide must play the same role in our bodies. CBD and other Phytocannabinoids essentially act as an artificial source of Anandamide. It has a weak effect on the CB1 receptors, and a slightly stronger effect on the CB2 receptors. This is the reason it is works as a non-psychoactive analgesic and anti-inflammatory drug. It also acts on the main hot and cold receptors in the same way as Tylenol and Menthol do respectively. Another use for CBD is to counteract the negative side effects of THC. Everyone should know that CBD is another drug that those with Liver problems should avoid. 

The last medicine is simply Ibuprofen, the basic anti-inflammatory. I’m not going to go into the activities of this one other than to say that long term use can cause Gastritis, or inflammation of the stomach. There are other drugs that I have used to treat myself, including Dextromethorphan, THC, and a certain Analgesic plant by the name of Kratom. All 3 have their own specific actions relating to the Endocannabinoid system, but I’m simply not going to go into the actions of these drugs as all 3 are psychoactive and I’d like to avoid any controversy. I obviously have never taken every single one of these drugs at once...I’m definitely a bit strange, but not to that extent. There is no particular reason that you need to get high in order to utilize the Endocannabinoid system. In fact, even Chocolate will give a little boost of Anandamide.

Many of you may be cynical about the effects of these drugs, and I respect that. The simple fact is that this treatment has most likely never been attempted long term on anyone but myself. Despite this fact, all of this information is just sitting on the Internet. The only reason it's been ignored is because nobody seems to have thought of it before. The Endocannabinoid system was discovered less than 30 years ago. Since then it has been ignored by just about everybody. I’m not going to go into the many very immoral reasons why nobody particularly cares about it, I’ll just let you use your imagination. The simple fact is that it seems to play a role in every single disease currently known, and the fact that you’ve never heard of it will do absolutely nothing to change that. If you’ve never experienced the activities of the Endocannabinoid system you're implying that you’ve never jogged or eaten chocolate in your life. 

I do not know if this treatment will cure anything permanently, but I do know that it has made me feel better than I’ve ever felt in my life. I’m not the first one who has said this, but I feel that the Endocannabinoid system is essentially our “soul” simply because it seems to be the bridge between Psychiatry and Physiology. For example, Autoimmune diseases usually occur after a stressful event in a person’s life. This implies that the cause of many of these diseases is simply long term Psychological pain and stress that manifests as muscle tension and eventually inflammation due to activation of the nearby CB2 receptors. Another great example is Covid-19, about which I have a theory that I sincerely hope is correct...it would explain a lot. This theory revolves around the idea that the increased metabolism of bats implies a strong Endocannabinoid system, as all mammals have one. The reason SARS 2 is so strong seems to be because it evolved to slow down the ECS first with nonspecific symptoms like anosmia and fatigue, therefore slowing down food intake and the activities of the Immune system. Once this is accomplished is when the muscle aches, inflammation, fever, and all the other painful symptoms start. The body isn’t prepared for this because all defenses are down, and it seems that the Immune system panics and desperately tries to fight back. We also seem to become very stressed when that threshold is crossed, causing the release of Cortisol and decreased Anandamide production...which further suppresses an already tired System. Essentially it works a bit like an Autoimmune disease, which also explains why Cortisol seems to work against it. Regardless of whether or not this theory holds any truth, I have another one. Our best defense against Covid-19 seems to be increasing our Anandamide levels, because the more Anandamide we have the better our Immune systems work. There's a reason we take Tylenol when we have a regular Pulmonary infection.

The activities of the Endocannabinoid System are much deeper than this post could ever give it justice for. I have included many of my sources below, and I seriously doubt any of the information contained here is not also able to be found in at least one of them. However, please do your own independent research on this topic. I've been doing it for months, so I think you can spare an hour to learn a little more about yourself. I apologize in advance if any of this information is anything but 100% true, and know that I am the type of person who cares only about the Truth. Personally I feel that even if some of my ideas are wrong the simple act of bringing any type of attention to this topic is a good idea. You can ask your Doctor about it, but it is likely that they will be just as ignorant about the ECS as you are. I find the fact that I seem to be one of the only people in America who knows what Anandamide is to be ridiculous, and I think it needs to change. There is, however, one very odd reason that I believe this to all be true. There is a very influential person who I’m certain has been predicting this happening for years. Without these predictions this experiment simply wouldn’t have happened, as I’d be dead. Many people would actually be dead, as these predictions seem to be excellent sources of Anandamide. I have only mentioned one of my symptoms, but this person constantly refers to the rest and was doing so years before I noticed them. This person also refers to many of my physical and mental traits, and all of this is through the use of convoluted metaphors. I seriously doubt that these are simple coincidences, considering that Coincidence is quite literally this individual’s religion. I have never met this person in my life, and I have absolutely no idea how the hell they know so much about me. It makes absolutely no Scientific sense whatsoever, but if you honestly think that every single type of Science has already been discovered you're simply ignorant. This person’s name is Ashley Frangipane.

Do OTC supplements luteolin and moringa actually work for preventing the return of cancer?

I’ve read about some dietary herbal supplements can cause apoptosis of malignant cells, making them a companion treatment to chemotherapy, or a treatment to prevent metastasis. Even though these claims are the result of legitimate NIH studies and other reliable sources, I’m skeptical of their value because my oncologist did not mention them or seem to have ever heard anything about them. I think if there was any real merit to these drugs, they would’ve been recommended by someone, but no one - of the scores of medical professionals I saw - did. I don’t want to miss out on the opportunity to take something now that could be FDA approved in the coming years (so far, as far as I know, they’ve only been tested on mice), but also don’t want to buy snake oil.

There’s lots and lots more out there. My serious question is, if there’s real science behind the efficacy of these supplements, why aren’t they being talked about in treatment centers? Is it a matter of waiting for human trials? I’ll do anything to avoid chemo again, but don’t want to take the bait if there’s nothing there. I appreciate any educated answers.

biology,"Hey guys,

I'm taking some prerequisites for a nursing program, and I am wondering...

With the exception of sex cells, does every cell in the body (more or less; it doesn't have to be every last cell, but mostly) have all the same organelles (Golgi, mitochondria, lysosomes, etc)?

Do all of the cells have the exact same DNA in their nucleus as all of the other cells?

So, like, skin cells... do they have the same stuff inside of them as, say, respiratory epithelial cells?

We always see the same in-depth diagram of a cell, and then we see pictures of stratified squamous epithelium or whatever, and I dunno, I guess I'm just wondering... is that basic diagram of the cell representative of pretty much all cells?

And if they do all have basically the same stuff, how is it that all of the cells make up organs that are vastly different from one another?

And if different cells DO have different elements, why aren't we taught that clearly?

biology,"I just recently discovered that I have a fairly quick reaction time. I can consistently hit at about 150-170 milliseconds on any test. I Originally thought that my reaction time was 200ms-250ms because of my old slow computer. However, upon further analysis, I used the ruler test, in which I was able to even reach a few centimeters equating to 100 ms. It didn’t add up. Finally, I built a high speed, up to date computer and it read my average times ~50-100ms faster. It feels nice to know it’s above average, but my general question and reason for posting this is : why do some people with a high reaction time still suck at sports ? As far as I can remember, I’ve never been good at sports. I’ve done it all my life. However, I came to realization, or rather a theory. There were times where I could react, but I couldn’t physically intercept, meaning, someone can have a slower general reaction time, but still outmaneuver one with higher. Another thing I’ve noticed, is that, some things require careful thought. For example, I was playing god of war, and I couldn’t get the right button that popped up on the screen. It’s between Square, Circle, Triangle, and X. I can react to the pop up telling me to push a button for sure, but I couldn’t get the RIGHT button between the 4. I kept failing again and again. But wait, my reaction time is fast ! Yes well, the same is true with some sports such as, for example, boxing. You have to slip punches left, right, or down. Contemplating all three would add time to the general choice, so it’s fair to say, that choosing one direction to dodge before knowing how the punch is thrown or when, would undoubtedly speed up the response time. Not to say it slows down reaction time. It just requires more process to ensure that the right choice is actually made. I know the community is biology, but I was thinking this particular type of question ties into psychology as well. Most of the time, I take more time responding to things that I’m afraid to get wrong. So being more confident in every reaction that’s made is what people generally praise as quick thinking, especially done with precision and Accuracy.

The problem I have is that it takes me hours to make these cards and I usually have to split up the chapters into two days just to create a sufficient amount of flashcards; I can't spend hours doing this.

 So, as a visual learner, I would like to know if any other visual learners have different approaches to studying for biology. Should I write notes for each lecture and then summarize it by drawing diagrams?

biology,,Deck Review with Alector
biology,"So, you might have seen I've posted a couple of questions about ion channels, action potentials and their dynamics.

I've particularly been wondering about voltage gated sodium channels and voltage gated calcium channels.

Specifically, how calcium effects voltage gated sodium channels and how magnesium effects both calcium and sodium channels?

So, some helpful people on here explained how calcium being a divalent cation, it binds to negative charges on the external membrane of a neuron and this alters the voltage at which sodium channels activate... Others stated that calcium binds to negative residues on the selectivity filter within the sodium ion channel and this causes a block in the pore with which sodium ions can not get through.

Similarly with Magnesium, some stated that being a divalent cation, it binds to negative charges on the external membrane of a neuron and this alters the voltage at which sodium and calcium channels activate.  Also, others stated that it binds to negative residues on the selectivity filter within both the NMDA receptor channel and voltage gated ion channel and this causes a block in the pore that prevents calcium from entering.

So my question is, which of these mechanisms or theories are correct? Are they both correct or no? Have any of these been proven or are they just hypotheses?",Ion channels question?

Okay know that you know essentially what the black pill entails here are the 2 main models supported for sexual selection the good genes hypothesis and the sexy son hypothesis.

&amp;#x200B;

The good gene hypothesis in a nutshell essentially says females in the animal kingdom prefer males with certain traits which are beneficial to survival for instance in certain ape species the males teeth x2 as long as the females probably to signify stronger bite force.

&amp;#x200B;

The sexy son hypothesis essentially asserts that a trait that arose due to random mutations that didn't necessarily help the survival of the organism is seen as attractive to some females due to it being more ''aesthetically pleasing'' this kind of attraction starts to create a loop of sorts where generations down the line women choose ornamentation over survival and this leads to well extreme inter species sexual competition. This view is very applicable to some animals but I don't know if this is neccarily applicable to humans.

Anyways if both of the models being supported seem to point toward the black pill for animals why is it wrong to apply this model to humans. Human females are also very choosy and the males they choose for short term sex often happens to be off the first variant. 

&amp;#x200B;

Good example of purely looks based sexual success would be places like Tik tok you have an entire generation of youth being promoted purely because they look good and have good genes. Yet every time you say the blatant obvious that looks isn't subjective but is very fundamental in human behavior you get people getting uncomfortable why nature is a living breathing black pill.",If both forms of sexual selection leads towards a black pilled conclusion on animal nature why is it wrong to apply this to us.

biology,"Hello all! So I am reading this paper about cadherin like protein and how to allows parasite t.vaginalis (STD parasite) to adhere to host cell and ultimately kill the host cell. Here is the link to the article: https://mbio.asm.org/content/10/3/e00720-19

Anyways, in the paper they basically prove that their is a cadherin like protein (CLP) on surface of std parasites (t.vaginalis) that helps the parasites bind to host cells. As we know cadherin proteins help in cell to cell adhesion, so this paper essentially prove that their is a similar CLP found on these parasites.

**SARS-CoV-2/ COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the ability of molecular tests for rapid and robust pathogen detection in human population.** 

&amp;#x200B;

* In a series of studies, we designed, developed, validated low-cost quantitative real-time PCR for viral (BLV) detection. 
* Interestingly, by using SYBR Green detection dye, we were able to reduce the cost of a single reaction by a factor of 5 compared with most common assays based on the use of fluorogenic probes (i.e., TaqMan technology). 
* Our approach, applicable for many different pathogens, allowed a highly sensitive and specific detection and quantification of specific RNA/ DNA using different matrix (i.e., purified peripheral blood leukocytes, plasma, milk, etc.).
* Furthermore, the assay was harmonized in collaboration with 6 reference laboratories in Japan, United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium and Poland.

&amp;#x200B;

Quantitative PCR assays, even when performed by experienced staff, can yield large variability in the assessment of RNA/ DNA copy numbers without harmonization. 

Harmonization and standardization of molecular assays, i.e., qPCR assays, across diagnostic laboratories worldwide are key requirements for the ability to compare surveillance data globally. 

Through the sharing of protocols, the factors that may lead to the variation in detection may be elucidated. Although the unification of protocols and standards/ calibrators can significantly increase interlaboratory agreement, the laboratory setup and the availability of resources and reagents at each testing laboratory must be kept in mind. 

Harmonization should be a continuous rather than a one-time effort.

Hi all, as I mentioned, I am in pretty over my head with this genetics grad course that I don't really have the background to take. I'm not asking for answers, but if someone could walk me through how to think about this problem, I'd really appreciate it.

Here it is:

Consider this population. What is the average effect for each of the two alleles? What is the average effect of allelic substitution considering the following genotypic classes and frequencies?

I think that I know how to get the effect of allelic substitution once I have the first part (just subtract the alphas, right?), but I'm pretty lost for how to get the original average effects. We are given the equation alpha= a + (q - p) d, but I don't know what those letters stand for in this context. Any help here would be incredibly appreciated.

biology,"Hi all. I am getting my M.S. in Biology (focus in cell/molecular) this December assuming I pass everything. I've been applying to jobs recently and haven't heard back from anyone yet. That isn't bothering me so much as I haven't found any job postings where I feel like I would fit in or there are many job postings I am interested in but there are several requirements that I don't have and don't know how to get them via learning them in a job.

For example, I've learned about techniques like ELISA and RT-PCR etc but never have had an opportunity to learn them hands-on. Same with things like human cell culture or flow cytometry. So many job postings I am interested in require things like this, but I've only been able to take bio labs where I learned basic molecular and biochem techniques.

I did a prestigious internship last summer but didn't learn anything too new, and what I did learn seems like it would only apply to specific types of academic labs.

Additionally, I am currently in a metagenomics-based lab and am working with linux command line and bioinformatics software/online programs. This is really cool and I really like it but sadly cannot continue in this lab past the end of this year. However when I look for similar positions online they are all hardcore bioinformatics and require a lot of coding knowledge and experience, and I barely know some Python and R. I am really NOT good with coding, but I've become decently good with command line.

I'm also interested in possibly things like teaching/explaining science-y things to the public or to children but I don't want to be an actual teacher. I was interested in Genetic Counseling for awhile until I learned that you have to do specific Master's programs and have experience with trauma counseling. How the heck am I supposed to get that?

Maybe I am just not searching for the right things? I don't know. But I feel stuck and don't know what to do at this point. I used to feel like getting my Master's would open up so many more biology jobs for me but anything requiring a Masters also requires a bunch of techniques I have no experience with.

due to the question beeing long i have included a TL,DR at the end. 
in school i was taught that vaccines contain deactivated/dead viruses so that when they enter the body, it can memorize how to fight them off without risk of death.
Though, seeing how everyone talks about how long the vaccine for the (at least) annoying virus that you cant stop hearing about will take i am getting more and more confused. if a vaccine contains a neutralized virus (obviously not just 1 as in quantity but 1 as in the opposite of cocktail iykwim), how hard could it be to make? why wouldn’t one just heat them up (as my friend Griffith did with D. Pneumoniae), put them in a syringe and shoot it? If it is a matter of matching blood density, wouldn’t a common 0.9% NaCl solution in H2O work?
Also, while looking up this question on the net, i found that vaccines can contain latex(?) and aluminum(????) how can that be useful? i have done extraction of DNA on a banana, how harder could it be to make on a virus ( if it is a DNA virus)?

Now, apart from the chemicals it can contain, how is it actually made? The amount of time it takes looks like it is made very inefficiently. Does one need a superalb to make vaccines for simple or complex viruses, or can it be made using a small scale mostly DIY chem lab?

Mainly, I am interested in doing something related to wildlife management (fish or game). I have applied to maybe 100 full-time jobs, admittedly not *that* significant of an amount. Of those applications, I have gotten one interview and didn't get the Job. I thought that the problems I was having was due to COVID; however, it dawned on me that this is just how it is, few jobs with a plethora of people, in similar boats, competing to fill them. I told myself that in one-year's time, if i had no job prospects, I would study my ass off for the GRE and try to go to grad school. My ambition to do this is starting to wane though, because I have read a lot about people getting overqualified in this field and ending with shit pay, even with an MS, and my GPA, while decent, isnt the greatest at 3.25. Because my parents are gracious enough to let me freeload at home, I am able to get relevant experience with temporary positions and save basically all I earn (which will be nice because pretty soon I'll have a solid enough chunck of change to get a down payment on a house, provided I can score a real job down the road to pay my mortgage), but I am starting to even consider doing a full career change, such as getting a second batchelors in engineering (my engineering friends are all making upwards of $65k a year with no prior experience) or something else with better job prospects.

Fact Check: No-one is left in the current world who is unaware of Covid 19, and the result of Covid19.

There is a lot to find out about the novel Covid (SARS-CoV-2) that causes Covid sickness 2019 (COVID-19). In light of what is as of now thought about COVID-19, spread from individual to-individual of this infection happens most often among close contacts (inside around 6 feet). This kind of transmission happens through respiratory beads. Then again, transmission of novel Covid to people from surfaces debased with the infection has not been recorded. Ongoing examinations demonstrate that individuals who are tainted however don't have indications probably additionally assume a part in the spread of COVID-19. Transmission of Covid happens substantially more regularly through respiratory beads than through items and surfaces, similar to door handles, ledges, consoles, toys, and so on. Current proof proposes that SARS-CoV-2 may stay practical for quite a long time to days on surfaces produced using an assortment of materials. Cleaning of obviously messy surfaces followed by sterilization is a best practice measure for counteraction of COVID-19 and other viral respiratory ailments in family units and communities.

In order to battle against Covid 19, it’s important to consider disinfecting the living areas as mentioned above. But how are we going to execute that, using chemicals/sprays? How safe are they? I’ve come across an interesting product which works on a technology called “Nanoscopic Gaseous Cavities In Aqueous Solutions” also known as “NANOBUBBLE OZONE WATER GENERATOR”.

***Let’s understand more about this innovative product -***

**WHAT IS FAWOO OZONE NANO BUBBLE WATER?**

Fawoo Ozone Nanobubble Water unifies the natural cleaning power of water with ozone and modern Nanobubble Technology to create a safe and highly effective natural sanitizer and disinfectant.

In case of sterilization and disinfection by using Fawoo’s ozone nanobubble water, it can kill the Coronavirus 99.99% because the “phospholipid shell"" is destroyed immediately.

Developed by Fawoo Nanotech Co., Ltd. who develops and supplies the innovative nanobubble generator which can be used for agriculture, water &amp; sewage, industry &amp; medical field, and life &amp; sport.

[Nanobubble Generator](https://preview.redd.it/b3ulefwq29q51.png?width=1000&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2d68568bfbd811c7776f9f2625daae562b7b0243)

Combination of Nanobubble and Ozone3 kills viruses and other harmful  microorganisms. Let us understand how - 

What is NONBUBBLE?

[Nanobubble](https://preview.redd.it/n8domigt29q51.jpg?width=847&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ff3952c328d21aac28a5f074f73cb0eedca1df93)

Bubbles with diameter larger than 0.1㎜ rise to the surface quickly and burst because of great buoyancy, and microbubbles with smaller diameter lose air inside of bubble slowly by own pressure effect, are contracted and extinct sometimes. However, in case of nanobubble, it remains in liquid for a long time because its buoyancy is too small. Contrary to the usual air bubbles, nanobubbles positively affect the growth of plants and animals, water purification, disinfection and others because it is highly efficient in delivery of oxygen and other gas. 

Nanobubbles are extremely small gas bubbles that have several unique physical properties that make them very different from normal bubbles. These properties make nanobubbles a superior aeration method for a number of applications around the world. Nanobubbles are the smallest bubble size known, 500 times smaller than a microbubble, or about the size of a virus. At this scale, far more nanobubbles can fit in the same volume of water compared to other bubbles. They also have several unique characteristics directly related to their miniature size that includes neutral buoyancy, a strong electric charge, and a high transfer efficiency. Larger bubbles do not possess these characteristics, making them less beneficial in a number of applications when compared to Moleaer's nanobubbles.

[Moleaer's](https://i.redd.it/whklrenv29q51.gif)

Nanobubble’s lack enough buoyancy to reach the surface will follow Brownian motion. The net effect is that nanobubbles will remain suspended in water for months until they dissolve, traveling randomly throughout the body of water and efficiently aerating the entire water column. Subsequently, dissolved oxygen (DO) measured at the deepest parts of a tank or pond will match the DO recorded near the surface. This unique behavior enables nanobubbles to provide a homogenous distribution of oxygen throughout an entire body of water.

***Effects and Applications of Nanobubble***

Having a high level of DO hastens the decomposition of microorganism, raises foreign material to the surface easily and keeps decontaminating.

WHAT IS OZONE (O3)? 

[Ozone3](https://preview.redd.it/92zfo9hx29q51.jpg?width=847&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ed68f9209d2997ec75e3b7d189c5c93412ba0a4e)

Ozone is O3, a molecule made up of three oxygen atoms. Ozone is a gas that is low density and colourless under normal temperature. Ozonated water is created by adding ozone to water. The oxidation powers of ozonized water make it an extremely strong disinfectant with many applications. Additionally, ozone removes odor by destroying the molecules, bacteria, and spores that cause unpleasant smells. Ozone is a highly reactive molecule and is very quick to chemically react with particles that it comes into contact with in the air and on surfaces. The extra oxygen atom in the ozone attaches itself to other molecules, chemically changing their structure to create non-offensive molecules.

OZONE

AS A DISINFECTANT AGENT

An ozone molecule, owing to the split of the third atom of oxygen, is a strong oxidant. High reactivity and leaving no harmful residues make ozone an effective disinfectant in assuring the quality and microbiological safety of food. This is the property which makes it very effective in destroying microorganisms. It has been proven that ozone destroys viruses inducing hepatitis A, influenza A and coronavirus. The inactivation takes place mainly as a result of damaging the protein and capsule of the virus. It is equally effective in destroying several strains of bacteriophages. 

Dissolved ozone in nanobubbles remains for a long time and continuously decontaminates.

Ozone(O3) is an isotope of pure oxygen that contains unstable oxygen(O2) and oxygen atoms(O).

Generally, more than 90% of ozone is concentrated in the stratosphere. And, a little ozone always exist on the 

ground surface, so that air around the beach or forest contains ozone about 0.05\~0.3ppm. 

Ozone has beneficial effects of harmful UV protection, pesticide and heavy metal decomposition, sterilization, 

deodorization and air purification. On the other hand, it is also not good for the respiratory system when the concentration of ozone increases in the air. Ozone has not only strong sterilizing power and 

decomposition capacity for harmful materials, but also there is no secondary pollution or residue because it is reduced to oxygen immediately after the reaction. It is impossible to store and use ozone like any other gas because it can be reduced to oxygen easily, so that it should be made in the field and used if necessary. A half-life of ozone is commonly about 2\~13 hours in the air and about 15\~30 minutes in water depending on the surrounding conditions.

I am a bit confused concerning the HLA genes and the  stuff. If I understood well
-	MHCI is composed of an alpha chain (very polymorphic from the HLA-A or HLA-B or HLA-C gene) and beta chain (which is invariant). Are the sub-units come from (alpha1, alpha2, alpha3) different genes ?
-	MHCII is composed of an alpha and beta gene which are the HLA-DQ, DP, DR locus (where we have the genes for the alpha and beta subunits). 
-	Each genes are codominant, so we have molecules which come from the father and the mother. In this way, is it possible for MHCII for exemple to be composed of an alpha chain from the father and beta chain from the mother ? Or the MHCII subunits do not mix together ?

Thank you !",Can the MHC molecules be a mix from the father and mother ?

biology,"**Assumptions:**

a. Death can occur via factors other than ageing

b. There is no intelligence involved. i.e. Reproduction is uncontrolled and an species cannot change its dieting habits suddenly.

**Explanation:**  
**1.** **No Death with Reproduction**: If there were no biological death for a species which reproduces, individuals would exhaust the limited resources provided by the earth/environment or adults don't provide enough resource for offspring. And with very less chance of offspring surviving(they die via starvation) the species cannot cope with the environmental changes as it will nullify mutations. Also, there will be threat from dying reproducers which are constantly adopted with the changes of environment. e.g: Some trees can live like forever with out death but they are few in numbers.

**2. Death without Reproduction:** This kind of  species will be extinct after 1 generation.

The electron transport chain portion of cellular respiration contains IV complexes of protein/enzyme systems. Mitochondrial enzyme activity in muscles of old mice was analyzed and compared based on a regime of no exercise (NE), low intensity exercise (LE), and high intensity exercise (HE).  Enzyme activity of the four complexes of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) was used as an indicator.  Results were analyzed using a statistical analysis technique called ANOVA.  Statistical differences in data are indicated (\* p&lt;0.05, \*\*p&lt;0.01) with a p&lt;0.01 being of greater importance than data with a p&lt;0.05. .

	Exercise seems to have the greatest impact on \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ of the electron transport chain of the mitochondria?

	Complex I

	Complex II

	Complex III

	Complex IV

&amp;#x200B;

	 Based on this data, which statement is true of high intensity exercise (HE) in old mice?

	High intensity exercise results in increased enzyme activity in all four ETC complexes.

	High intensity exercise causes increased muscle growth.

	High-intensity exercise results in no statistical difference in the enzyme activity of ETC complex II and IV 

	High intensity exercise is more valuable than low intensity exercise.

&amp;#x200B;

	  The independent variable in this experiment was

	 Enzyme activity

	The ETC complex

	Exercise regime

	Age of the mice

&amp;#x200B;

	In this experiment, mitochondrial activity was measured by examining enzyme activity of the specific ETC complexes.   What would be another way to measure mitochondrial activity? 

	Monitor oxygen use

	Monitor carbon dioxide use

	Monitor ATP use

	Monitor water use

This is our research, Apical Meristem Cell Division Rates of Auxin and Cytokinin Plant Hormones Contrast with Non-hormonal of Brassica Rapa Subsp. Chinensis: An Experimental Quantitative Study. Our objectives are to determine the rate of cell division of the plant with auxins, and then cytokinins hormones, then compare it with the plant that doesn't contain any hormones. Another would be to determine which hormone would most likely be most fit for this kind of plant.

Cytokinin and Auxins are hormones that affect the cellular division of the plants. We were thinking of obtaining samples from apical meristems or roots of the plants to be studied.

But, the microscope at school, we're still trying to convince our teachers to allow us to utilize the instruments for our research. and even if we were able to get our hands in a microscope, the method that we're going to use to determine the rate of cell division is by counting the cells and comparing it with the number of cells a week before, and how do I mean by counting the cells, literally counting them 1 by 1 using images. I was thinking of using a hemocytometer, however, our budget won't make it if we bought one.

Is the method of counting the cells visibly present in a 1000x magnification microscope one by one and comparing it to the number of cells a week before to determine the cell division rate reliable?

**The Long-term Environmental Impact of Covid-19 in Japan**

**Introduction**

COVID-19 has affected the whole world, and Japan was not exception, but hasn't seen the massive outbreak like other countries.  
 It is known that in the beginning of the pandemic there was a decrease in industrial activity, traffic and tourism and all this leads us to witness the currently short-term effects in the environment, like the reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and local air pollution, because of the decline in the demand for energy or the increase of hospital waste such as face mask protection. This pandemic will have some significant impacts in the long-term too, although those impacts are still undetermined. So, what will be the long-term direct and indirect effects of the pandemic in Japan’s environment?

**Objective**

This research will study the changes of the diverse environmental factors such as air quality, meteorology, hospital and protection related waste, water pollution, noise pollution and some indirect effects too like fossil fuel consumption, industries productions and level of tourism. And all this data will be collected during the evolution of the pandemic. With this information it can be made the prediction on the evolution of those factors and evaluate the impact they’ll have, positive or negative.

With Japan being a environment conscious country, and always moving in the direction of sustainability, has the resources and the need to identify what will be the implications of this pandemic in the environment.

**Methodology**

This research will be performed by collecting data (air quality, meteorology, hospital and protection related waste, water pollution, noise, fossil fuel consumption, industries productions, levels of tourism and others.) before and during the beginning of the pandemic, so we can make an analysis later on the short-term impacts. This will be supported with other articles on the topic: COVID-19 and the environment. After this first step, the collection of data will catch up with the present moment, it will still keep being collected but now will be less information at a time, and in this phase it can be started the data analysis, at the end of the stipulated time of research, we can use the analysis made with all the data to create predictions on how the effect are going to change and evolute.

Data of hourly ambient air pollutants, daily meteorology, the COVID-19 cases, will be requested from the Atmospheric Environmental Regional Observation System (AEROS) if provided by the Ministry of the Environment, Japan Meteorological Agency, J.A.G JAPAN Corporation, respectively. Other data will be gathered from national agencies in Japan. The data will be presented in the form of maps and graphs.",Need Research Plan Advice

biology,"I'm a 19-year-old South African immigrant and I'm currently in my second year of college. I came here about 7 years ago with no English or educational background where I essentially started from scratch. Throughout my life, I was playing ""catch-up"" with my classmates (ie., English, math, science, etc). Since I was younger, I was able to grasp the English language and other concepts more quickly compared to my older friends and family. 

Growing up in America as a teenager changes a person a lot. I tried so hard to fit in with my classmate and in retrospect, there was such a barrier between us at the time that I didn't have anything to connect with them. Constantly being worried about the wrong aspects of life (parties, drugs, girls...) has led me to lose track of what I wanted to get out of life. I was always an average student - nothing remarkable about me. I told myself who am I to dream big, I'm not smart enough, etc and lost the confidence to learn anything. I gave up on myself.

So, now, I'm trying to make an effort to be useful in my life. I know that I didn't come to America for no reason. However, I just don't know where to start.

During my first year, I took Bio 1 and received a C+ and took Chem 1 and received an A+.  That's all the sciences I took. I really, really want to get good at biology, but I don't know anything about it. I didn't learn anything from last year because I was too focused on the wrong things. What should I do? I want to focus on human biology (don't know the specific yet) and I'm concerned that I'm behind again. Where should I get started? What were the bio courses you took in college (in its order) to be good at biology?

Currently, I'm taking Chem 2 and Bio 2 along with some psych courses. I'm really concerned about Bio 2 (ecology, evolution, and biodiversity) and feel like I will get a B or C again. I'm not so interested in those topics and I have to take it as a prereq for the upper-level bio. And what is keeping me alive right now is the evolution and genetics topics lol. How did you handle bio in undergrad (or how are you currently handling bio)?

If anyone could please talk about their experience with the human biology field (or any biology field) and the sequences of biology courses they took in order, I would greatly appreciate it. I really hope this is the right subreddit for this, if not please refer me.",Where should I start?

Several viruses can trigger carcinogenesis in humans and animals. HTLV-1 and BLV (Deltaretroviruses) cause neoplastic proliferation of T and B cells, respectively. Silencing proviral gene expression is necessary for an efficient immune evasion, the establishment of persistent infection, as well as for disease progression towards a lymphoproliferative disorder. A better understanding of (i) the epigenetic control of the provirus, (ii) the cis-elements present in the LTR, (iii) the enhancers with cell-type specific regulatory functions, (iv) the virally-encoded transactivator proteins, (v) the role of repressors in transcription and silencing, (vi) the effect of hormonal signaling, (vii) implications of LTR variability on transcription and latency, and (viii) the regulatory role of non-coding RNAs, may allow for the development of more effective treatments against Deltaretroviruses.

&amp;#x200B;

  

**Highlights**

During the chronic Deltaretrovirus infection the immune response limits viral replication and the mitotic division of latently infected cells allows viral expansion and disease progression towards a lymphoproliferative disorder. Different approaches to interfere with Deltaretrovirus latency might avoid the development of cancer.

We reported for the first time spontaneous and high level of Deltaretrovirus transcriptional activation in natural hosts chronically infected with BLV. Spontaneous virus reactivation could have implications on Deltaretrovirus pathogenesis and transmission.

We observed BLV DNA in 59% of milk samples from lactating cows and the level of BLV DNA inversely correlated with BLV-specific antibody titers in this secretion. By the consumption of raw milk, calves might be exposed to infectious virus favoring the perinatal transmission of BLV.

I know that hypercalcemia (increased calcium) decreases excitability and and action potential is less likely to occur, whereas hypocalcemia (decreased calcium) increases excitability and firing rates, but how? What exactly is the mechanism?

Some people I've asked and science sources stated it has to do with altering the threshold potential. That since calcium is positively charged ion, it gives the extracellular membrane a more positive charge. So if you reduce extracellular calcium, the extracellular membrane will become less positive therefore lowering the threshold potential and bringing it closer to the resting potential and by doing so, it makes it easier for depolarization to create an action potential.

Other sources stated that the effects are due to the fact that calcium blocks voltage gated sodium channels
Which depending on the extracellular calcium concentration alters the flow of sodium through the channels which in turn alters how depolarized the cell becomes.

biology,"Obligatory I’m on mobile, sorry for formatting.

So I’m a (very new) researcher in a lab working on cutting-edge techniques to study stem cells. This position is a real dream job for me, and I’ve been there around a month now. Everyone is super smart but also chill, I feel very supported by my coworkers, and I’ve been thoroughly trained on various procedures. It’s a big lab with multiple rooms, and I’m still having a bit of trouble remembering where stuff goes and where things are stocked, but I’ve been assured that I’ll figure it out soon and it just comes with experience. I’ve managed to not fuck up anything major yet, just a few minor mishaps here and there that were easily fixed. Until today. 

So yesterday, I spent hours prepping some samples of stem cell colonies to be cryosectioned (aka frozen in a tiny block, carefully sliced into super thin sections in a super-cold machine, and placed onto microscope slides to stain and take pictures of later). It was the first time I was doing this procedure by myself, and it’s a lot of steps of carefully adding and removing liquid from tiny tubes over and over, each time being careful to not damage the sample. 

Something of note is that these samples were NEARLY A YEAR OLD (like 305 days old). They were carefully grown and taken care of for countless hours, and they’re very fragile. We usually start off with a lot of samples and only get a few after the couple hundred days, so it’s really important to not fuck up the final stages of prepping these samples for imaging.

So I carefully did the series of steps and ended up with 6 blocks, each block containing a handful of samples. I knew I wouldn’t have time to actually slice the sections that day, so I carefully wrapped each block in aluminum foil and put it in the fridge overnight. 

Yes, the fridge.

For the all-important, definitely frozen, nearly year-old samples that were SO CLOSE TO BEING READY TO ACTUALLY USE FOR EXPERIMENTS, after not fucking up any of the actual complicated steps to prepare them, I ruined it all by putting them in the fridge instead of the freezer.

In my defense, the lab has a bunch of fridges and freezers and they all look basically the same... except the freezers are very clearly labeled “Freezer...” and I’d definitely used this fridge for fridge stuff before so I definitely should have known better...

So when I unwrapped the blocks to section them today, it was a melty mess of media and sad soppy samples. None of the 6 blocks were salvageable, and they all had to be thrown away. Oops.


Epilogue:

I immediately told my kind-of-boss about my fuck up, he looked at it and said that the stuff I was prepping for him could just be thrown out and he had backups so it wasn’t a big deal. But for the one block that was for my boss-boss, it was kind of a big deal so he said I should ask her what to do about it. My boss is pretty chill, but this was not a minor accident and I was definitely nervous to tell her. My kind-of-boss offered to tell her for me, and I half-heartedly said that no, I really should take responsibility for this since it was my fault, and he said that it wasn’t a big deal for him to tell her, so I quickly gave in and said sure.

He came back a bit later and I asked if she was mad and he got quiet so I knew she was pretty mad. But then we went over the importance of having legit protocols printed out, and he assured me that everyone makes mistakes like this at some point and it’s no big deal. And on the bright side, I’m never going to make that mistake again in my life.

TL;DR; After nearly a year of researchers growing samples and hours of my time prepping to slice them up into tiny sections to be stained, analyzed, and used in experiments, I put them in the fridge overnight instead of the freezer. They melted everywhere and were totally unsalvageable. Now I know the difference between the fridge and the freezer.",I just ruined a year-long experiment by putting it in the fridge.

I always wanted to be a scientist as a kid. Things didn't work out that way.   
I love keeping up on the literature. I thought I still wanted to be a biologist. I fell in love with ornithology (NOT BIRD WATCHING), started volunteering doing bird stuff in my area (game bird surveys, migration tagging, etc), and went back to school. It's been good. Only...I hate academia. I love experiment design, I love journal club, I love fieldwork, I love statistics. I love being out in the field for hours, weeks, whatever. I am totally delighted by observing and working with animals in the field, and all the loooong empty hours, bad weather, and bodily fluids that come with it. What I do not love is the process of publishing and I do not love the egos. I am willing to give up the chance at the eventual power and freedom to direct projects and pursue my specific interest areas, to avoid selling my soul, my personal time, etc. to academia. Frankly, I'm too low-functioning to devote myself to it without destroying the rest of my life. I can't do it. Probably no scientist loves it. But I am learning my limits. I think this is one of those limits. I don't NEED the money, I don't value the prestige, and I have mental health/cognitive problems that make it daunting. Truly, I'm not sure I could have ANY serious career and still take care of myself. It's taken me a long time, lots of therapy, meds, and occupational therapy just to live independently. I don't want the workload of a postdoc, or anything that comes after! I'm fine doing the crappy work just to be involved at all. Could I be that lucky?  
I feel like the vast majority of summer research gigs an even unpaid positions are increasingly competitive, and I get the vibe they are looking for promising up-and-comers. (Which I'm not. Because I'm not going anywhere after my BS.) Is this true? Is  there any chance that someone with just a BS (maaaaaybe a Master's, if I absolutely must) can participate in a field like this, get paid something at all, and be involved in projects? It makes me sad when I collect lots of wild bird data for FWS and then am totally uninvolved in the process of understanding that data, what the data means for harvesting laws, etc. I'm not allergic to the idea of industry jobs (fish and wildlife service, animal rehab centers, etc), there just aren't a whole lot where I live, and they tend to be very competitive. I would be happiest assisting others with fieldwork/data/etc. and I don't mind traveling seasonally to do it.   
I simply do not know if anyone without a PhD actually does this, because I'm not privy to the academic world at all. I'm just a bird nerd going back to school, and if I tell people I want to study birds, but don't care to be a tenure-track PhD, I tend to get funny looks. Terrified to ask only full-fledged ornithologist prof at my campus this question, probably should not be worried to ask as he is the only person who can really mentor me here, but...baby steps. It's all pretty daunting to me. 

**TL;DR** &amp; To sum up **actual question**: Is it possible for someone with just a BS to participate in fieldwork gigs and research projects indefinitely, when the have no plans to seek academic positions/PhD? Is there info I should know about taking this approach? Other sage advice?",Academia isn't for me. Can I still be a biologist?

biology,"Hey all,

I'm a bio major but my area of study is pretty specific and I have a question that I'm not qualified to answer:

I am a hobbyist chemist, and a lot of the reactions/experiments I run involve transition metals in aqueous solutions. Unfortunately, this means that I have to process a lot of metal waste to prevent various compounds from ending up in the environment. I am very strict about the truly toxic compounds (chromium, antimony, lead, etc) but I'm constantly trying to improve my handling of other heavy metals like copper, cobalt, nickel, etc.

Normally my procedure when I have an aqueous solution of a transition metal is just to add a more reactive metal to cause the heavier metal to precipitate out. I then filter that off and (depending on the solution/volume in question) either evaporate the rest off or simply pour it down the drain. The most common metal used for this is aluminum, meaning that various small quantities of aluminum solutions end up in my (and many other chemist's) sewer. Generally people accept that aluminum is far better for the environment than metals like copper or cobalt.

I really don't like doing this and it got me thinking - if one assumed that they would *always* put their metal waste water down the drain, which metal would be the *least harmful* if it ended up in the local ecosystem. Due to the nature of chemistry, there are only a few metals that are candidates and could be used. They are magnesium, aluminum, and zinc. Iron would work in many instances as well, but the reactions can be quite slow.

The resulting solutions contain ions that are quite common in nature such as chloride, nitrate, and sulfate, so those ions are not an extreme concern. Obviously excess nitrates are not great for waterways, but again the quantities that I'm dealing with are small and pale in comparison to fertilizer runoff from even a single yard.

So, in essence, if you had to pick one of those four metals (Mg, Al, Zn, Fe) to go into waterways, which would you pick? Which is the least toxic to flora/fauna?","Most ""environmentally friendly"" metal? (Explanation inside)"

biology,"Today we had a microscope exam in my intro microbio class. All he said was to “focus the sample on 400” so he sat down to watch all 3 of us do that on our own microscopes. I got so frustrated after 15 mins I was using the course focus and everything on 40x (my mistake now that the professor told me that, I forgot we can only use fine focus on 40x). The girl before who used the same microscope I used took probably 20 mins but I’m not sure if she found the sample on the microscope. Anyway, while I sat there for like 20 mins 2 girls had came in separately used the same microscope one after another (no they didn’t watch each other) and both of them found it in less than a whole minute maybe a little over 

My professor was jokingly telling me that I could switch microscopes, I did just to prove my point that: (I accepted my L by this point so I didn’t say anything out loud) having someone set the microscope to the right position makes it significantly easier of finding in quicker. 

I switched to this magical microscope (lol) and found it with 30 seconds tops. 

When I brought it up to him (yes I said I’ll accept the F or whatever but I wanted his opinion lol) he said “yeah but it’s about technique, you can’t use a coarse  focus on 40x” fair enough....but when it was already set for you, you all you would have to use is fine focus after you switch from 10x.

After I switch from 10x on my first microscope I didn’t see shit and I did this multiple times. 

My last point is that mustn’t not been that stuck on technique if he left out of sight every once in a while even while one of the girls was still finding the specimen. 

Does that make sense? I confused my own damn self 🤣 yes I deserve the F, but am I crazy or is there a little sense to this. Lol please let me know. 
He joked about “blaming it on the microscope” and he is better at using a microscope than me so maybe I’m being over dramatic.

Also, last part is that after we found the specimen on 40x we call him over to look. Then we turn off the light, lower the stage all the way

Anyone here have much experience with *very* long-range PCR? I am hoping to amplify a \~50kb segment of high-quality genomic DNA.

Hi! need help in analyzing this exam question that came up. I will greatly appreciate answers with explanation. 

What is a type of drug action which causes inhibition of cell function by occupying receptor sites:

A) Antagonist

B) Enzymatic Action

C) Agonist

D) Action Inhibition

I answered Action Inhibition but I was incorrect because the right answer should be Antagonist. From what I can recall, an antagonist is a type of drug and the word drug action is one of my major inferences in concluding my final answer. I notice that I didn't see from the PPT that it is an antagonist that causes inhibition of cell function but it is called a drug and not drug action. Is my final answer correct? Because for me, action inhibition does include occupying receptor sites that causes inhibition of cell function. Is drug and drug action the same?

That's not what my question is about, but rather if germs can travel through the air once it has settled. My question has nothing to do with the coronavirus (or at least not specifically that)

*Question:* If something is dirty and has a lot of germs, do I also get those germs on me if I'm close to it, or just in the same room as it? Let me try and explain it to the best of my ability. Suppose I’m in a room that's dirty and I just stand there. I don’t touch anything, I just stand. Will the germs make their way over to me? Or if I have a plate of food and a glass of water surrounded by dirty stuff. Will the food and water, get some of those germs? Or if I hover my hand over some stool (sorry for the not so appropriate example). Will some of the germs make their way over to my hand. Essentially my question is whether or not germs/dirt/grime/gunk travel through the air or is it only once you’re actually in contact with it.

This morning, I read a NYT publication about the Johnson &amp; Johnson coronavirus vaccine that’s about to enter stage III clinical trials. The vaccine uses an adenovirus to introduce genes for specific COVID proteins into our DNA, so that we express those proteins and the immune system is able to respond to them. 

My weariness may just be a result of me being at the end of my knowledge of the subject, but wouldn’t this type of vaccine be inherently more dangerous than, say, an antigen-presenting shell? What if it integrates somewhere other than the target site and causes a frameshift mutation in our DNA?

I’m interpreting it as essentially being genetic engineering. My lab uses a very similar method to introduce GFP into our model animal so we can track target protein expression, which I would argue is definitely genetic engineering.

It turns out that ginger root has a high concentration of a protease called [zingibain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zingibain), which can be used as a meat tenderizer and as a replacement for rennet in the making of cheese. I am interested in making cheese, so I looked a bit more into this aspect of zingibain and found a Chinese desert called ""Ginger Milk Curd"". 

To make this dessert, milk at 65C, a small amount of surgar, and fresh ginger juice are combined in a container. At around this temperature the zingibain is most active, and it will rapidly hydrolyze the casein in the milk and turn the mixture into a gel.  


I found a blog post with the recipe and a more in-depth explanation here: [https://blog.khymos.org/2014/02/24/ginger-milk-curd/](https://blog.khymos.org/2014/02/24/ginger-milk-curd/)

He is also Australia's leading erotic poet

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/book-genre/poetry/

shows Godels 1st and 2nd theorems shown to end in meaninglessness

http://gamahucherpress.yellowgum.com/wp-content/uploads/GODEL5.pdf

Godels 1st theorem

“Any effectively generated theory capable of expressing elementary arithmetic cannot be both consistent and complete. In particular, for any consistent, effectively generated formal theorythat proves certain basic arithmetic truths, there is an arithmetical statement that is true,[1] but not provable in the theory (Kleene 1967, p. 250)

but Godel cant tell us what makes a mathematical statement true,

thus his theorem is meaningless

even Cambridge expert on Godel Peter Smith admits

""Gödel didn't rely on the notion of truth""

thus by not telling us what makes a maths statement true Godels 1st theorem is meaningless

and for some relish

Godel uses his G statement to prove his theorem but Godels sentence G is outlawed by the very axiom of the system he uses to prove his theorem ie the axiom of reducibility -thus his proof is invalid,

Godels 2nd theorem

Godels second theorem ends in paradox– impredicative

The theorem in a rephrasing reads http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems#Proof_sketch_for_the_second_theorem

The following rephrasing of the second theorem is even more unsettling to the foundations of mathematics: If an axiomatic system can be proven to be consistent and complete from within itself, then it is inconsistent.”

or again

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems

""The second incompleteness theorem, an extension of the first, shows that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency.""

But here is a contradiction Godel must prove that a system c a n n o t b e proven to be consistent based upon the premise that the logic he uses must be consistent . If the logic he uses is not consistent then he cannot make a proof that is consistent. So he must assume that his logic is consistent so he can make a proof of the impossibility of proving a system to be consistent. But if his proof is true then he has proved that the logic he uses to make the proof must be consistent, but his proof proves that this cannot be done

note if Godels system is inconsistent then it can demonstrate its consistency and inconsistency

but Godels theorem does not say that

it says

""...the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency""

thus as said above

""But here is a contradiction Godel must prove that a system c a n n o t b e proven to be consistent based upon the premise that the logic he uses must be consistent""

But if his proof is true then he has proved that the logic he uses to make the proof must be consistent, but his proof proves that this cannot be done","The usefulness of Godels theorem for biology: Some argue ""This latter statement is Gödel's second incompleteness theorem. ...

biology,"I honestly don’t know where to start but, I graduated with a Biological Sciences degree in June from a top public university in California and have been looking for a job with no luck. In college I originally wanted to just graduate and go to pharmacy school. I found out that I really hated pharmacy and looked into other health professions, shadowed, and honestly hated all them too, I started looking at other career paths and fell in love with Computer science, I tried to change my major at my university to computer science in my junior year but was denied because I was close to being done with my bio degree and would go over units. However, I took a few CS courses and ended up getting accepted to multiple programs, but ended up choosing a part time online program where I will be receiving my degree in computer science in 2022, I chose this program so I could work full time. However, in the meantime I would like a somewhat decent job to pay off loans and fund my current tuition for my CS program. I am currently working as a temperature screener making $16/hr and working a local retail store making $15/hr. The hours are not consistent and I range between 30-60 hours a week combined. I have been applying to mainly lab technician and QC analyst jobs, I don’t see much I qualify for. At this point I have applied for thousands of positions, and have only received 4 interviews, 2 interviews I did not make it passed the second round, one I made it to the final round but did not receive an offer, and one I received the job but it only paid $14/hr and they wouldn’t budge to pay me more, I couldn’t take the job as that is a ridiculously low wage especially requiring a bachelors degree, I get paid $15/hr at Target so I had to decline. I followed up with each company, 1 told me they could not disclose information but the other 2 both told me my interview was good but there was a “more experienced candidate” at this point I have honestly gotten so discouraged and depressed. I know we’re in a pandemic but it’s like fuck, I spend hours a day applying, networking, having professionals in the field reviewing my resume and LinkedIn and I get nothing out of it besides some interview experience. I don’t know what to do anymore, I know these positions don’t pay well but I absolutely need something better than my current pay, as I have loans stacking up from my first undergraduate degree and now I’m paying for my CS program as well, money is slim and I’m barely scraping by doing DoorDash and Postmates on the side (this is starting to fall apart now too with the subscription based service it’s no longer feasible to do). I’m located in the Bay Area and would like a job that pays $20/hr or more as I honestly won’t be able to make it much longer at my current wage. I have about a year of lab experience, thousands of hours shadowing doctors, physical therapists, and pharmacists, previous chemistry tutor, 1 and a half year of management experience, internships in the hospital, internships teaching elementary students math and science, internship teaching elementary students computer science. Is there any other jobs I qualify for? I’m literally willing to take anything, grind my ass off and be the best employee I can but need at least $20/hr because of my current situation.",Finding a job

biology,"bme vs cheme vs mls

okok first of all hi, i know that these types of questions are always asked but i made alot of research on all 3 majors (biomed eng, chemical eng and medical/clinical lab sciences)

also im still in high school, but here, changing ur major (even if ur in a american credit system uni) means paying for the whole thing all over again (unless its a small change like from bme to cheme i guess)

anyways, my goals in life are:

• end up working in a lab as a researcher (i’m interested in diseases and ways to treat them, so maybe research in biomedical sciences ig).

• working in a medical/clinical lab (i really dont mind it but i think that everythings gonna be repetitive with the tests n shit)

• being in academia. (as a professor or something idk).

• working in a drug company / biotech companies.

• or being the engineer who works with a cardiologist help a specific patient with heart problems through a medical machine that future me/biomed engineers make. (im not very educated when it comes to this cardiology thingy i dont really know much abt it).


ps: i dont like the normal cheme work with the big industrial plants.

anyways, i really wanted to go to med school and study medicine, however if i study mls, ill go in as premed. and im very indecisive but im 100% sure that i wanna continue and go to grad school (either for an md, ms, or a phd) ill ask the advisor if i can study cheme / bme with pre med but ik thats gonna be one hell of a coursework)

however seeing the courses and the classes that ill take in college in biomedical engineering im barely interested in any class unlike chemical eng or medical lab sciences. but maybe it’s because bme has few normal science/theoretical classes and mainly focuses on meche and electrical eng? idk tbh.

oh also im so bad at math but were working on that.

also i feel like im not very interested in majors like bio or chemistry because i find them boring and i feel like i like to work/study and be in a lab all the time.

idk if i forgot anything but i wanted to ask people who personally studied / worked in these majors/fields because im confused and stressed &lt;/3

thanks if u read the whole thing and all replies will be appreciated lmao &lt;33",bme vs cheme vs mls

Greetings from Manipal BioMachines!

We are a group of highly motivated students from various disciplines, working together in the field of synthetic biology and genetic engineering to find a solution to methylmercury poisoning, the underlying cause for catastrophic disasters like the Minamata disease and the Basra Poison Grain disaster. 

The MIT Manipal iGEM Team will attempt to give the proof of concept of a probiotic bacterium which can convert methylmercury to elemental mercury to reduce its toxic potential. We will also extensively survey the effects of industrial effluent discharge with the incidences of neurological disorders and theoretically develop a probiotic product based on our bacterium capable of tackling methylmercury poisoning.

We want to present this project at the iGEM (International Genetically Engineered Machines) competition. The iGEM Foundation is an independent, non-profit organization dedicated to the advancement of synthetic biology and applied biotechnology to find solutions to real-life problems. iGEM attempts to change the way Biology is taught and understood, allowing students to learn by doing and creating.

Participation in this competition requires us attend the 2020 edition of the Giant Jamboree, the culmination event of iGEM. We wish to seek your help to procure funds for the same.

We hope you can help us pioneer this effort and represent MIT, MAHE at a global stage.

No previous coding experience necessary! 

Many neurological conditions such as Parkinson’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease are driven by genetic factors, and while some of these genes are well-known and studied, others are not. But how do geneticists dig through millions of datasets to identify novel genetic contributions for various neurodegenerative diseases? ⠀
⠀
In this two-day workshop, we’ll learn how to use genome-wide association studies (or GWAS, a type of analysis that scans the genomes of many different people to identify genetic markers that can be used to predict the risk of developing a disease) and polygenic risk scores (PRS) to uncover the genetic basis of neurodegenerative diseases. ⠀
⠀
You’ll explore the fascinating complexity hidden in our genome with a series of hands-on data explorations using command line, the statistical programming language R, and a suite of analysis tools including FUMA, PLINK, and GCTA.    ⠀
⠀
You’ll walk away with a basic understanding of GWAS and PRS analyses, their challenges and limitations, and how we can practically apply them to detect individuals at high risk for disease. ⠀

biology,"Hi there, 

I'm a second year master's student biology, I'm specializing in molecular biology and found this highly enjoyable. My primary interest goes out to neurobiology.

Lately, I've been having a lot of doubts about how  I want to continue my career path. When I finish my masters, I have been studying for a total of 8 years(BSc + MSc, BSc took longer due to extracurriculars, a switch in majors and an 8 month sabbatical) and will be 27 years old. For my MSc, I expect to graduate with a GPA of 3.3 or higher, will have done a minor thesis, a major thesis and an internship. My major thesis will likely lead to the publication of 1 or 2 articles/protocols.   
However, before I went to the university, I actually wanted to join the military for a long time. Once at the university I thought I felt more at home there, coupled with an anxiety disorder I figured the desire to join the military would subside. Instead I joined the Army Reserves and served as a private and now as a corporal for nearly 4 years now. This way I could exercise both my interests at the same time.   
I feel like I now have hit a crossroads again,  becoming a professional officer is once again becoming very appealing to me, but so is academia. If I would join the military, I would do a 7 year contract, which includes almost 2 years of training. The pay is similar to that of a PhD in the Netherlands. 

I want to write down all the pros and cons on this issue, and one of the things that I would need some more information is described in the title: 

If I choose the military after graduation, will I still be able to return to academia after 7 years? Or would a leadership/management position in a company/institute that works on neurobiology be (more) feasable?

biology,"I read a post several years ago – It was in a long-gone science-oriented forum -- and I can find nothing about the subject now and am wondering if any of you know about this.

A researcher – I’m quite sure he was/is Russian – was observing a species of ant. When an individual ant foraged away from its nest it laid down a scent trail and followed that back to the nest. 

(As a sidelight, when the ant was foraging, he played with it by placing barricades its way, forcing it to cross its own trail many times. It always found the original trail back to the nest and he theorized that it must have had to do with the strength of the scent signal.) 

When an ant was away foraging, he removed part of the trail back to the nest, breaching the scent stream. 

When the ant was returning to the nest, it would encounter the breach. Every ant of this species would then always begin walking an ever-increasing clockwise spiral. Every ant – always an ever-increasing spiral -- always clockwise. This is a good strategy because one of three things will happen: it will (1) encounter the original trail beyond the breach, (2) encounter a nest-mate, or (3) encounter the nest. And it will always cross the trail before the breach several times as a point of reference.

This researcher was doing a lot of work on DNA for a specific purpose. He strongly believed this was an innate rather than a learned strategy. His goal was to modify the ant’s brain to change its action from walking a clockwise spiral to walking a counter-clockwise spiral. He can’t read and modify a brain, but if he could better decipher the language of DNA, and if he could find which suite of genes constructed the ant’s brain, and which was specifically responsible for the neurons dictating this particular activity, then he could attempt to modify the ant’s DNA to change the action in the next generation to prove he did it.

I went off on a tangent studying other things and I lost track of the Russian.

I do have strange assumption, that consciousness is related to intelligence. When I said intelligence, I dont mean referred to complex being like human. But try to see Mold (physarum polycephalum) here:

*https://youtu.be/2UxGrde1NDA (What humans can learn from semi-intelligence slime)

*https://youtu.be/40f7_93NIgA (What self-driving cars can learn from brainless mold)

They do have capability to know their surroundings, memories and learning. The question is do they have consciousness? 

Based on 2 example videos, my wild assumptions is that we can derived consciousness into 3 important part:
1. Capabilities to know your surroundings
2. Capabilities to memory something
3. Capabilities to experience something

If we accept this as proto-consciousness, then what is the fuction of our big brain in human? Because mold did not have brain as ours.

Personally, I am interested in zoology, systematics and evolution for the most part, so I looked for labs that worked with anything of these. I also have a decent background on molecular biology techniques, but lack field work experience. After speaking with a handful of potential PI's, I have ended up between 2 labs:  


Option A: Evolutionary biology lab. This lab works mostly with mitochondrial DNA and researchers there experiement on heredity of mtDNA and the reasons why it seems that in some cases the sperm's mtDNA passes on to the offspring. They also work with general population genetics on animals and microbes. As for techniques, they almost exclusively utilize PCR. There is also quite a lot of computer work.

&amp;#x200B;

Option B: Molecular systematics lab. This is a fully equiped molecular lab, where the researchers are able to do PCR, sequencing and electrophoresis. They study phylogeny, evolution of certain taxa, phylogeography and optional field work in case we need more tissue material for research. Most undergraduates in that lab learn how to extract DNA from tissue, do PCR and sequencing for various projects.

biology,"I read a story on r/tooafraidtoask where OP said some kind of magic spell was cast on their small town, but they (and their grandma, who lived outside of town, but later came to the town) were unaffected by the spell. The spell caused a strange store to appear out of thin air, when OP visited the same place the day before, but there were just trees where the new store was going to be. 

A day later OP's family asked them to come to this strange store and OP never heard of it. They were driven to the place where there were just trees and now a mysterious store was there and everyone in town except OP said the store had been there for 20 years and that OP was crazy and must of been there before. Everyone in town was now close with the store's owner who lived just across the street from this mysterious store called ''The Y''. 

OP says it appeared a week or two weeks ago. 

It was highly upvoted and several Redditors said it was possibly magic, and linked to several magic-related subreddits.

My question is, why don't they bother tracking down the person who cast a spell that not only caused a mysterious store to literally pop out of thin air, but also re wrote the memories of 99.9% of the town's residents?

biology,"Hello guys and gals,  


I'm looking to get licensed in teaching and wanted to get into two fields that are in high demand for international schooling: English (which I've always excelled at and loved) and Biology (as its the only ""hard science"" that I have any real experience in).  


Now for some background. I have a B.A. in Psychology and finishing an M.Ed right now, so I'm fairly savvy with research methods and stats. However, through most of my pre-college years, I hated science. I felt completely illiterate trying to read anything involving science and always felt I just wasn't smart enough, especially in Chemistry.   


Despite this, during my psych undergrad in college, I had to take a basic bio class and a bio psychology class. For some reason, when bio was attached to something I enjoyed, I really felt so much more about what I was learning (crazy, right?). I also got very interested in the biology of combat sports and weight lifting as I got involved in those areas. I got so fascinated with bio psych that I ended up being the top student in class and got invited to do undergrad research with a major behavioral neuroscience study at my university.  


Fast forward to today. I haven't touched a bio class in years, and I've basically dropped off the face of the earth with any of the science related stuff I used to listen to and read in the past. If you quizzed me on anything bio these days, I'd probably get an F and laughed outta the room by my examiner.   


My long winded question is this: what are some ""fun"" ways to educate yourself on bio? Are there good podcasts for complete noobs to the field? Any fascinating books or websites? Have any of you taught bio and what did you do to prepare for success? Part of why I'm doing this is because I wanna inspire other kids who struggle with science by showing them avenues that they can enjoy as well.

biology,"tl;dr at bottom.

&amp;#x200B;

I will start off by saying I do believe in evolution and have a fair amount of academic background in evolution classes. It never has interested me all that much so I have not taken too much time to fully delve into the topic in as much detail as I should. 

This semester (of my Master's in Biomedical Anthropology) I am taking Evolutionary Medicine in which one assigned reading had to do with Americans not believing in evolution, why they don't, and how to change that. It got me thinking a lot and I am honestly too scared to ask my professor in fear that she will think down on me for thinking this/not knowing the answer. 

My question is, why do we care so much if some people do not believe in evolution? Don't we have bigger things to worry about, for example, that some parents don't vaccinate their children because they think it causes autism? That is a bigger issue to study and attempt to change the minds of all who think that. Why do we care so much that some people really truly believe that Adam and Eve created us all? 

The class perspective is that evolution can explain many health issues and further medicine. For example, diseases prevalent in older people happen because we need our people to eventually die or the population will be too large. However, most people that do not believe in evolution will not be able to grasp this topic without extensive schooling on both science and evolution. So they will not ever gain the benefit of understanding health issues through medicine anyway. 

So if they are not benefitting themselves, what is the negative aspect to some people not believing in evolution? Am I missing something detrimental that is going to impact the human population if people continue to just think the way they do? 

Sorry for the rant/word vomit I am just curious and confused. 

&amp;#x200B;

tl;dr : most people will never be able to grasp evolution in its entirety due to a lack of foundation knowledge in genetics/biology/etc that it will likely never actually have any impact other than frustrating scientists that have spent their lives studying this.

&amp;#x200B;

For a lot of reasons, it's really important that we have a sample return mission to collect whatever this life is.

We don't know as much as we'd like to know about the origins of life on Earth. We don't know if it was 'dna' first, rna first, metabolism first, etc. Hell, we don't know if Cairns-Smith's 'mineral life and genetic takeover' theory is wrong either. We can get at a lot of information about early life, like shared genees across domains, but some things still seem totally out of reach. Life on Venus obviously doesn't have to be an exact mirror of what happened on Earth. But they're both rocky planets of similar size in similarly cozy places of the Sun's Habitable Zone, so it can tell us alot. And life on Venus today is probably, like on Earth, 4.8 billion years away from it's origin, that's a lot of evolution.

Imagine if these microbes are RNA based. That would be pretty good evidence for an RNA based origin of life on Earth. Again it's not a 1 for 1 parallel, but if I was researching the origins of life and this stuff was RNA based, I'd focus on that more.

We also don't know a lot about the environment in which life first formed on Earth, the 'reducing atmosphere' isn't as strong a theory now as it was 20 or 30 years ago. THe geological history of Venus can inform us about the origin of life there and by analogy again life here.

A lot of people are trying to downplay this as 'just some chemical', and if it never went beyond that it perhaps wouldn't be too interesting.

If you have an immune response, over time you will become depleted of key nutrients, those consumed in relevant amounts. For example vitamin D (without this exemplification being important)

Question one: 

How can anyone find a complete list of amino acids, vitamins, and minerals involved in immune response with qualitative descriptions of consumption rates? Qualitative, because I assume there will be variations.

Question two:

Does anyone know of a resource where one can find how consumption rates relate?

For instance, I believe the metabolism rate of vitamin D and copper will relate. Say, if you are low on vitamin D because of an immune response, and take supplements (vitamin D only), you will reduce the level of available copper because an immune response consume both vitamin D and copper.",Complete list of immunonutrition components

The peahen sees the magnificent tailfeathers of a peacock and says to herself “What a cumbersome burden those feathers are. Any guy who can sport those feathers and not get caught and eaten by a predator must have super genes. I think I’ll go introduce myself to Mr. Right over there.”

Ok, that makes sense. But if I was the peahen I’d be asking myself “Do I really want to burden my children with those things? The only thing they’re good for is to catch a mate and to get caught by a predator. Maybe I’ll find myself some peacock whose genes may not be quite so good, but who at least won’t saddle my children with an albatross around their necks.”

It seems to me that the handicap may be a tradeoff that could lessen the average reproductive success of the offspring as much (or maybe more) than it could be a driver of sexual selection.

What is the current thinking on the Handicap Principle? Have there been studies comparing the overall reproductive fitness of peafowl offspring coming from peacocks with fabulous tailfeathers against the fitness of peafowl offspring coming from peacocks with smaller, less burdensome tail feathers? (Or similar studies in other species.)

I know that those gaudy feathers wouldn’t persist in the population if they were a net detriment to reproductive fitness. But the mechanism of selection might not be the Handicap Principle. I could imagine some mechanism where the large tailfeathers are simply a pleiotropic characteristic that goes with stronger wing muscles or a better immune system – or maybe they just give the bird better balance while it’s sitting in a tree.",What if the Peahen doesn’t want her Offspring to be Handicapped?
biology,"I mean I'm a college Sophomore taking intro Molecular and Cellular Biology right now. So far we haven't really gotten into the cells and genes part of it yet, were're just learning about the molecules. At first when I heard that the ""you know who"" suggested injecting bleach, I was like ""no way!"" because ⚠️☠️⚠️☠️. That was even before I started taking the biology class, I don't know in detail why injecting bleach is bad, I just know that injecting bleach = death due to poisoning based on common sense. 

I'm not an expert, I'm just a college student taking my first biology class. I didn't really give a shit in high school so this is the first time I actually learned things in biology. However my thought is that injecting bleach would be harmful because bleach is a base and a base would definitely wreck the pH levels in the blood and cause acidosis(bleach is a base). I also know that the structure of a protein is important for it's function within the body and cells, and personally I believe that it would wreck all the proteins in the body. First off if you zoom all the way in you would see amino acids linked together by peptide bonds via dehydration reaction (in which monomers are linked after the loss of a water molecule).  This order of the aa's in a protein is called the primary structure. Personally I don't think that the primary structure would be affected that much by injecting bleach because the fact that the primary structure basically consists of covalent bonds.  However if you zoom out you'll see the secondary, tertiary, and Quaternary structures, these structures are sensitive to disruption in hydrogen or ionic bonding.  Bleach would definitely be a thing that disrupts proper hydrogen or ionic bonding and aggregation of proteins (especially if it dissociates in water).  Since even a small change in the proper structure of a protein would change the way it behaves, I understand how bleach would be harmful. 

**However I'm not sure how correct I really am, again I'm not even close to being an expert.

biology,"I don't know how this will go over in this subreddit, but I will just be open about why I am asking this question, and hopefully someone will help me out. I don't know where else I can go to ask about these things, as I am a layman in terms of biology, so while I've done research (and would love to do more if anyone has relevant links) I don't feel comfortable just reading a few papers/articles on the subject, which don't (and couldn't possibly) directly relate to my reasons for asking this question. Instead of relying on intuition, I'd appreciate feedback from people who know what they're talking about.

I like to write for a hobby and I am in the process of writing a horror novel. In this story, the monsters are part-human and part-canine, mostly resembling foxes and coyotes. Basically, a werewolf story, but not with wolves, as I feel they're overused as villains. The story requires these animal-people talk, even though it would be on a rudimentary level. As a layperson, I imagined that if a werewolf-like monster tried to speak, it would be in a very clipped, guttural manner and very difficult for that creature. Like they were coughing or vomiting words out. Another comparison that occurred  to me as a layman was a facially disfigured person trying to speak. They could do it, but it would come out awkward because they wouldn't have the right ""hardware,"" so to speak. Something kind of like Mason Verger in Hannibal by Thomas Harris, if anyone's read that.

Regardless, these monsters would still need to be physically capable of understanding and vocalizing human speech. Thus, if I am writing a scene where a fox-person or coyote-person speaks, I want to know what anatomical changes I would need to make to accommodate their ability to pronounce vowels, syllables, words, and consonants. For instance, would the tongue have to be more human? In addition, what anatomical changes would I need to make to their brains to accommodate their ability to significantly understand human speech? For instance, would the shape of the cranium need to be different to accommodate a larger brain?

I did some research into why animals can't talk, and came across articles that confused the issue somewhat, as it seems some animals (like many birds) can imitate human speech perfectly (even if it's questionable that they understand it) without requiring any outward changes to their anatomy, given their vocal musculature is specifically designed for imitating any sound. Meanwhile, other animals need to alter their physiology in some way to achieve this. For instance, a beluga whale needs to overinflate its nasal cavities while an elephant needs to use its trunk to modulate its vocal tracts. Meanwhile, animals that are physiologically closer to humans, like apes, may have the vocal ""hardware"" to imitate human words, but remain unable to do so. This is because they do not possess a region of the forebrain (shared by humans, birds and other vocal learners) that allows them to imitate sounds outside their species. 

Reading articles like these makes me wonder if, in describing these potential changes to their brains, lips, tongue, and vocal tract, just how outwardly apparent would these changes actually be to someone observing the creature? Outwardly, would they essentially just look like ordinary canines (discounting other anatomical changes I'd make given that they're humanoid)? Would it only be in, say, an autopsy scene on one of the creatures, where the differences in their vocal tracts and brains would be apparent, thus explaining their ability to speak? 

I would just appreciate any feedback on these ideas and which direction I should go in. I would also be more than happy to read additional articles anyone wants to link me to, as this is interesting reading to me in general, even outside of how it is relevant to my novel. I understand a reader probably isn't going to question how monsters in a horror novel are going to talk, but it's something that bothers me*.* I want to address it for myself, even if it doesn't end up significantly explored in the novel.

I also want to take a moment to clarify that I understand some people may dislike this post as it could be argued I am not truly discussing biology, but science fiction/fantasy concepts. Although a lot of this post is discussing real-world biology, I understand this point-of-view. But I don't know where else to go to talk about this with people who could provide useful feedback. I thought about asking about this without mentioning my novel. But I came to the conclusion that I need to be honest and upfront about my reasons for having these questions. If I'm not, it will limit the ability of anyone to give me useful feedback.",What are the biological reasons animals cannot talk and use language?

biology,"I graduated with a BS in Biology from a decent state university in 2017. During my undergrad I took the usual courses and I had the opportunity to do some very limited fieldwork relating to 
ecology and had hopes of finding a job relating to wildlife conservation but I did not network as much as I should have in college and did not have a job lined up for after graduation.

Having not made any meaningful connections with professors or done much undergrad research as well as being very low on money I decided grad school did not seem right for me and I took some time off of school to travel.

I was fortunate enough to have a part time job (basic minumum wage and unrelated to biology) that let me take large amounts of time off and since I was finally free of school commitments I spent the next two years 
working part time and traveling.

 I wanted to continue my education but I did not have much money so I had the idea of potentially teaching highschool as it only requires a Bachelors, is in the education realm, and I could maybe save up and go back to college at some point.
I made some connections, got a bit of relevant work experience related to education last summer, and was set to start the teaching path this year but unfortunately the recent pandemic has ruined those plans as schools closed down to go online or are reopening and causing teacher strikes.


I've spent the better part of the last 7 months in isolation watching unemployment skyrocket as the pandemic ravages the US and losing any real hope of finding a career job. It's been 3 years since I graduated and I feel like as time goes on whatever knowledge and skills I gained in college are fading.

Is my degree worthless? I feel as though a BS does not qualify me for much and I'm not sure how to gain job experience at this point. Is higher education the only answer? Is massive tuition debt a good idea during a recession?

biology,"Hey guys, my deepest apologies for being a sort of outsider here and not knowing the terminology. This may even be a 'stupid question' without me knowing it. (Note: I'm not a botanist, I have no experience whatsoever with plants)

I'm a generalist who likes to experiment, and I'd like to experiment with getting plants to 'compute'

I heard from a neuroscientist that the electrical signals in plants are too slow for any kind of meaningful computation.

However, this only got me wondering whether electrical signals were the only means by which I could 'communicate' with the plant in a way, in order to get it to compute.

In other words, are there much faster 'mediums' to go through, or processes, or systems or 'inputs'/'outputs' to be able to interface with.

Another way of framing it is to ask, what sorts of stimuli do plants respond most quickly to?

Eventually, I would like to see if I can get a relatively fast computer, but of course my (perhaps beginner naive) tendencies tell me that I'd probably need to start with something that's very simple, slow, and boring.

However, just getting that first step (of getting a plant to do something very simple) can also be incredibly rewarding.

Faster inputs/outputs will allow for a much faster feedback loop of iteration for my experiments as well.","What are some of the fastest types of signals in plants (e.g. are they electrical, chemical, or a combination, or something else entirely that's a whole system) and is there a name for it?"

biology,"Hi reddit.  

I graduated with my BSc in Biology (molecular/genomics focused) in May 2019.  I thought I wanted to go into academia, but errr I don't think so, so I'm hoping you've got ideas!  

I'm now in a Lab Manager position (at a university), and I have picked up on some new aspects I might want in a career.  I think I may be interested in something like R&amp;D project management, but could really use some perspective!! 

Here are my favorite parts of working so far (to put my questions in context):

\- I love non-redundant lab work.  I used to work at a private company working on developing bio-based chemicals.  Badass subject and the products/goals/experiments were always changing and evolving.  

\-Currently my favorite part of my job is learning about everyone’s work and passions, and philosophy on research and then fitting that into an overarching vision.  I'm working to more formally organize the effort/resources in our lab, and (with results) want to ask my employer pay for me to get my PMP (reasonable/worth asking for?).

\-I love that when I manage the lab well, it directly helps my coworkers succeed.  It directly impacts their ability to do good research which makes them happy.  Extremely rewarding.  

\-I love that in my current position I am a little bit involved in every project (ie heading PR for one project, and aligning genes for another), on top of management which is its own hodgepodge of stuff.  I really like hodgepodge-iness, it's fun! 

\-open to a master's and or PhD if that is the background I need 

&amp;#x200B;

Some questions I have are:

\-Are there a lot of PM jobs in research? 

\-Do I have to give up all bench work to be in management?  

\-Are there a fair number of management positions that require a background in science?  (I don't think I'm interested in a position that can be held without some background in research. )

## [DNA Double Helix? Nah. Give Me Six!](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-020-0539-8)

DNA, the molecular blueprint of life, also moonlights as an origami artist. By carefully choosing a collection of DNA sequences, scientists can coax the strands to bend and fold into complex arrangements at a nanoscopic scale. [Lulu Qian](http://www.qianlab.caltech.edu/index.html), at Caltech, even used DNA origami to create “[the world’s smallest Mona Lisa](https://www.caltech.edu/about/news/worlds-smallest-mona-lisa-80563)” in 2017. But DNA nanostructures have thus far been limited in scale. A new paper from [Hao Yan’s](http://yanlab.asu.edu/People.html) group at Arizona State University has created a “six-helix bundle DNA origami nanostructure”, called meta-DNA, that can be used to construct larger, three-dimensional structures. The work was published in *Nature Chemistry*. [Read the ASU press release](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/09/200907112333.htm).

## [Apples Get Sick, Too. Can CRISPR Provide the Diagnosis?](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/pbi.13474) (Open Access)

China produces nearly half of the world’s apples, which are subjected to an onslaught of viral pathogens. Those viruses have all sorts of fun names, like the “apple stem grooving virus” and the “apple scar skin viroid”. Fending off these viruses, and saving an orchard, demands early detection. That’s why Xianbo Zheng’s lab at Henan Agricultural University developed a CRISPR/Cas12-based system that can detect as few as 250 copies of certain viruses on an apple tree leaf, and return results in less than an hour.

*Here’s a riddle for you:* If an apple a day keeps the doctor away, what do apples eat to stave off illness?

## [Using Robots to Automate SARS-CoV-2 Testing](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-18130-3) (Open Access)

When I studied at Imperial College, my dream was to use the Biofoundry. A full room, humming with robots, was surely the cure for my monotonous experiments. But, alas, it has been put to better use. In a *Nature Communications* article out this week, [Paul Freemont’s](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/p.freemont) group reports a “reagent-agnostic automated SARS-CoV-2 testing platform”. In other words, the Biofoundry was used to perform RNA extractions, RT-qPCR, and CRISPR-based detection methods for the virus. It was even tested on patient samples, installed in NHS diagnostic centers, and will purportedly increase “testing capacity by 1000 samples per day”.

## [Massive CRISPR Experiment Proves Not All Cas Proteins Are Equal](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0646-5)

When designing a gene editing (or base editing) experiment, it’s important to pick the right protein. Each Cas enzyme has its quirks—they differ in size and specificity, for example—but these differences are rarely *quantified*. Thankfully, [Ilya Finkelstein’s](https://finkelsteinlab.org/) lab at UT-Austin have published a paper, in *Nature Biotechnology*, that can help delineate the finer differences between Cas enzymes. In a massively parallel experiment, they benchmarked the cleavage and binding specificity for five SpCas9 variants and AsCas12a with “over 10,000 targets containing mismatches, insertions and deletions relative to the guide RNA”. The result? A better understanding of how mismatches between gRNA and DNA target alter the performance of a Cas protein (for example, “Engineered Cas9s, especially Cas9-HF1, dramatically increased cleavage specificity but not binding specificity compared to wtCas9.”)

## [Gene Expression Controlled with Light](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-0639-1)

Why use chemicals to control gene expression in a cell when you could use photons instead? Chemicals stick around for a long time; gene expression becomes “leaky”. Photons, on the other hand, can be easily tweaked, spatially controlled, and turned on and off (at the speed of light). To bring light-controlled gene expression to bacteria, the [Avalos lab](https://cbe.princeton.edu/people/jose-avalos) at Princeton has “developed a series of circuits for optogenetic regulation of the lac operon”, which they call OptoLAC, “to control gene expression from various \[chemical\] promoters using only blue light.” The study was published in *Nature Chemical Biology*.

biology,"I have recently become interested in Kaijus, and the idea of giant creatures. The largest animal to have ever lived is thought to be the blue whale, and the largest land animal to have ever lived is still in question, but it is believed to to be a sauropod dinosaur.

From what humans have discovered, this is as far as nature has gone, but is this all that nature has to offer? Are kaijus possible?

My challenge is for you to come up with a scientifically plausible kaiju, and here are the requirements:

* It can live anywhere life can, but its body should be able to resist the any harsh restrains of its environment (gravity, pressure, etc.)
* Must be anatomically possible. If you stretch a human into King Kongs size, but do not change its anatomy, it simply would not work because that body type could no longer support the body. 
* Must have a scientifically possible origin, which means it must be part of an evolutionary branch, or it could be have its own, but it must have an origin that is possible. None of that cheap Hollywood quantum science level crap.
* Include its diet. What does it eat?
* Include its role in the environment? What helpful things does it do?
* Time period of when it lived?
* Is it still around? Or did it go extinct? If so, why?

If you're bored, try to see if you can come up with something. Ill try to do my own.

I have a BSc in biological sciences with a specialism in Microbiology and am looking at my options for masters degrees, I have just narrowed it down to two choices(both 1 year long). The first option is an integrated (aka super cheap) non-taught research masters likely studying a niche subject I enjoy (bacterial competition mechanisms). While the second option is a more expensive taught masters in another university on infection biology with a specialism in either virology or bacteriology.

An important factor in this decision is my future aims. At this point in my life I was hoping to be better informed on wether I would pursue a career in academia with a PhD through the experience of a summer lab placement, but said placement was sadly cancelled due to covid. So currently I am primarily looking at the option of academia or becoming a clinical scientist for the NHS through the highly competitive STP program.

My conundrum comes down to what I perceive to be passion vs employability. I feel the research masters would give me a years worth of critical lab skills that would help me in the highly competitive STP acceptance program or work in industry/academia. However I fear this niche research topic limits my possible academic future into a subject that isn't exactly where my heart lies. Regarding the second masters I would enjoy the taught theory based learning that would be missed in the MRes along with the opportunity to study an area of science I find to be most fascinating. However I feel this masters would on one hand help me pursue a PhD I am more passionate about while on the other hand lessening my employability for industry/STP.

I am I wrong in my assumptions? Would the MRes be more beneficial all around or should I go for the taught masters I am more passionate about? Thanks!",Passion vs Employability: Microbiology Research Masters (MRes) vs Taught Masters (MSc) Advise (Academia vs STP NHS clinical scientist) (UK)

biology,"I have this more strict notion of phenotype as a more ""direct"" developmental or physiological product of genes. The more environmental variables/events are definitive of a given physical or behavioral ""trait,"" the less it seems proper to me to call it a ""phenotype.""

The eye color you're born with, a phenotype; if you use contact lenses with a different color, not worth calling it a ""phenotype.""

One gets stabbed and survives, the scar itself is not a phenotype; characteristics of the wound healing such as the development of keloid or not are, or may be, depending on how genetically driven they are.

But apparently some people (I'm not sure if actual biologists) will argue that anything you do is in away your behavioral phenotype. Contact lenses of different eye colors would be a behavioral phenotype of some personality trait that's prone to that once it's available in the environment. Maybe with society being a collective phenotype in a way.

biology,"I'm looking at schools for fulbright apps for next year. I'm interested in a molecular biotechnology masters with a focus on microbial and plant biotech. I've narrowed it down to two universities: Waneginen University(Netherlands) and KU Leuven(Belgium)

**Waneginen University(Netherlands)**

* Pros: literally the top school for my field of study: # 1 in the world for agriculture, #8 for env. sci. and #20 for biology.
* Cons: in a small town in rural Netherlands, so there's not much to do. The big cities are a max 2 hour train ride away so its not awful, but during the week you're in the middle of nowhere. Also its name brand is not as strong.

**KU Leuven(Belgium)**

* Pros: it's in a quaint, lovely city right outside Brussels, and its a good school for my field of study (#45 in the world for biology). It also has a moderately strong name brand.
* Cons: it's a good school for life sciences but its not the top school, and not for my field of study

**Everything else about the choices are pretty much the same to me**

1. I've compared the curriculum of the two masters from each university and they're eerily similar. I really like both.
2. Each school has many research labs studying exactly what I want to work on!
3. On a larger scale, they're geographically similar, as the countries are bordering.
4. I admire the culture and quality of life of each country.

**Please help me decide! What do you think is more important to make a decision on? Can you attest to either school or their name brand based on your experience, or knowledge as a European? I'm planning on entering industry after my masters, if that info helps.**","Which one for fulbright masters in biotech?: top school in middle of nowhere, or good school in quaint city?"

The only issues I can foresee is the blood cells dying due to a lack of oxygen and glucose, but adding glucose and ECMO can fix that, right? The other issue is that the virus will decompose before antibodies can develop. So why don't we draw blood and infect it, then inject it back into ourselves once antibodies develop?","[Immune system question] Why can't we draw our blood, infect it with a virus, wait for the antibodies to develop, and inject it into ourselves for the antibodies to reproduce?"

As in, how do they form those specific structures wich complement the antigen ? I am aware of VDJ (and the one T-cells go through as well) recombinations, but how do our cells choose and make those specific recombinations that form proteins that exactly complement the antigen structure? 

Is it something that happens by chance; a random recombination process that makes receptors specific to an antigen by chance, such that we already have these as we develop the immune system as foetuses, or is it something that happens when we encounter new antigens in life ?

biology,"Warning: I am not a biologist, I took a course as an undergraduate a while back but I thought this idea was interesting enough to bother knowledgeable people to see what they think.

The context for this idea was thinking about vertical farming and how inefficient plants are at photosynthesis. We can harvest solar energy a bit more efficiently than plants, but we need them to make our food. Chloroplasts have come up with an electronic method to harvest light since it is where most of the naturally available energy is in the electromagnetic spectrum, but it's not a particularly easy thing to harvest and is inefficient, albeit functional.

What if we made an artificial environment where energy is available at a much lower frequency? I'm envisioning ""plants"" grown in the dark between large metal plates oscillating at some radio frequency so that slower processes like molecular reorientation or ion migration can take place. The end goal is of course to create an overall more efficient method of conveying electrical energy to biological systems.

My first thought on how to approach this is to start with some convenient microbe and artificially select/breed them by slowly diminishing the original source of energy while supplying them with a juicy AC field to utilize instead. If (when?) you get a strain that can actually utilize this then you can select for efficiency, and later other useful traits so you can put it to work. Maybe this would take a few million years to succeed, but it seems like it must be easier to harvest than visible light.

&gt;1. Highlight several clear differences in the structure and function between the bacteria and the virus. Also, give examples of bacteria and viruses.

Bacteria and viruses are microscopic, which means they are too small to see with the naked eye. They can enter the body through any opening, but most often they enter through the nose and mouth. The first difference between the two pathogens that I can think of is that one is a living organism and the other is not. In order to be classified as a living organism, it must fulfill some characteristics, such as that it is made of cells, that it grows and reproduces, that it responds to stimuli, that it can transmit genetic information. If only one of these properties is missing, it is not considered a living organism. Bacteria meet all these requirements. They are made of a single cell that divides to reproduce and maintain homeostasis as their environment changes. Bacteria are probably the most diversified of living organisms on the planet. There are billions of different species of bacteria, and there are bacteria in the human body. Bacteria in the body are not necessarily dangerous, researchers have discovered that bacteria play an important role in the body's microbiome, so bacteria are beneficial in various ways, as they help us digest food and keep the skin healthy. Without a healthy microbiome of bacteria in the body, we would not be able to eat certain foods, and we would get sick more often. Current bacteria are the unicellular organisms, and are different, and are found all around the world. Viruses are not the same, as viruses and bacteria have more differences than similarities. 

Depending on who you ask, you will get the answer that viruses are living organisms, but they are not as they cannot, for example, reproduce without hijacking the host's cells, and this means that they do not have the capacity to reproduce like bacteria. The people who call viruses living organisms also argue that the specifications that life should meet are not right, and do not just ignore those rules. All other living things can reproduce without taking over the cells of another organism and using it for their own purposes. Living organisms either find a partner and reproduce, like humans, or split in two with a form of asexual reproduction like bacteria. Viruses cannot do any of these things. Viruses also do not respond much to stimuli. Viruses alter the cell's genetic code for their tailored needs, and can cause cells to make copies of themselves, along with capsid, which is a protective protein shell in a virus that protects the virus' nucleic acid, and infects cells.

Evolution through natural selection is an important concept when discussing living organisms, as all living organisms evolved from a previous species. All organisms evolved from an organism that started life on this planet billions of years ago, and humans and bacteria have undergone many different changes and evolutionary steps, but both viruses and bacteria evolved from previous species, which is why we need a vaccine every year. against the flu. Although viruses lack several traits to be classified as a living organism, some species appear to evolve when a mutation in DNA occurs that gives the organism new traits. Mutations are random errors in the DNA, which means that some are good, others are bad, and others have no effect on an organism's survival at all. But with viruses, it happens that mutations happen often and quickly, which means that a new form of virus can develop quickly.","Need help with the differences between virus and bacteria, with respect to structure and function"

biology,"Some say chimps can survive a sledgehammer or knife to the face and keep attacking, also pull apart concrete walls like nothing, throw refrigerators across 10 feet, and flip a 3,000 pound car over or even play with 200 pound rocks like it was a pillow, do they even know how light a pillow is this true or over exaggeration to make chimps look strong because of that incident, even though that was a 50 year old average woman who have weaker skin and weaker bones.

Some people say a juvenile chimp can defeat a strong person, which i think there just wanking chimp strength. I ask why do they keep wanking chimp strength? It's the same thing when they say a strong trained human with a knife has the same chance with the chimpanzee as with the average human with no weapon, do they ignore that a trained human with a knife have killed bigger things a chimpanzee.

People also say a 60 pound chimp would absolutely destroy a bloodlusted trained 400 pound deadlifter. Why do people keep wanking chimp strength, do they keep confusing viciousness and fighting dirty with strength.

They also say a chimpanzee can rip an arm off even thought to rip an arm off like a wookie does in one second you need over 30,000 pounds of force without twisting the muscle and tendons and they say they can pull fingers off. People also compare small monkey arms to the persons arm to say that it proves they can do the same to a human. Which you can't compared So are people getting confused with twisting and strength exaggeration or are they ignoring that to make chimps look strong because of bias. Since there has been no case of arm ripped off, only bones popped out of socket. So those quora stories aren't true.

Also some people think they can kill a lion attack or have a chance of beating a gorilla. It's probably because of that bili ape myth but even then people defend it and say it proves it.

Chimpanzee's are 2 times stronger than humans and the other test have been proven to be exaggerations but why do people in battles keep going with the old science test of chimpanzee strength. Some people defend it and even say the newer ones are trying to down play there strength, are people that ignorant and biased to keep chimp strength so high.

If they were 8 times stronger than a human they would be stronger than the orangutan which is 7 times stronger than a human. Also some people say they can defeat a tall 400 pound trained deadlifter, because they compared incidents where it involved old people like the old man with nose bit off or that incident with the woman. You can't compared a deadlifters bones and muscle to people in those incidents, because they have weaker skin and bones, or they were the average person. Do people ignore that all chimpanzee attacks had teeth involved, do people ignore the teeth involved to make chimps look strong. If they do then why.

Also in fight forums they seem to ignore that a bloodlusted strong trained human could fight as vicious and dirty as a chimp, but people ignore that. Probably because of bias. I ask again why? People say any human would have no chance against a 90 pound 3 foot chimp, since that's the average chimp size. Even though a trained bloodlusted, hysterical strength tall deadlifter that's fighting dirty like the chimps that fight dirty can defeat the average chimp.

Chimps strength is overrated, there only 1.32 to 2 times stronger than the average human. Were some tall deadlifters are multiple times stronger than the average human. The best recorded feat of chimp strength was 1,260 pounds and there was no other study, and the strongest lift ever recorded by a human was 6,270. People probably won't believe that but Paul Anderson was born and built different so it was possible for him, so people would probably believe someone telling them that a chimpanzee flipped a 3,000 pound car then a human doing it. Probably because of chimpanzee biased because of those incidents, even though that was an old woman and the other one was and old man, also the nose is easy to bite off, though a gorilla can do it with great effort. And don't ignore that a strong trained person without hesitation of violence can fight dirty like the chimpanzee when attacked by it.

&gt;Continue breastfeeding when you’re sick. You need to make sure you get the right treatment, and to rest, eat and drink well. In many cases, the antibodies your body makes to treat your disease or illness will pass on to your baby, building his or her own defences.

Now for the question:

&gt;Blood clots in arteries, such as in the coronary arteries, can be dissolved by injecting streptokinase into the bloodstream. Streptokinase is formed by bacteria and rapidly breaks down blood clots. The first treatment with streptokinase is much more effective than the second treatment. The diagram below shows the concentration of antibodies to streptokinase in the blood after the first and second injection of streptokinase, respectively. The second injection was given 10 weeks after the first.  
&gt;  
&gt;The [graph](https://imgur.com/4N3AjdD) shows the amount of antibodies against streptokinase in the blood depending on the time after injection in the number of weeks.  
&gt;  
&gt;Solid line = first injection  
&gt;  
&gt;Dashed line = second injection  
&gt;  
&gt;a) Compare the effect of the first and second injection of streptokinase during the first 4 weeks. How can the differences in immunological response be explained?  
&gt;  
&gt;b) Why is it that the manufacturer does not recommend the use of streptokinase in a possible second blood clot shortly after the first?

My answer:

An elevated amount of antibodies to streptokinase may explain why streptokinase is not effective the second time of a treatment, and we can see it in the dashed line. These antibodies prevent streptokinase from acting on the blood clot, and are formed afterwards when the streptokinase is injected. The process itself is that the antibodies bind to streptokinase, which means that they bind in large clumps and can not function properly, the immune cells break down the streptokinase because the immune system sees it as a foreign substance.

Streptokinase comes from bacteria so it can easily cause a response from the immune system compared to other proteins. As for the difference in the immune system, this is the first time the body is exposed to a completely new foreign substance as it will not have any memory cells that respond to the antigen. An antigen is an infectious agent, and memory cells protect us from these antigens. The specific immune system that is included in this context consists of T and B lymphocytes. The T lymphocytes are divided into cytotoxic T lymphocytes (killer cells) and helper T-cells. Some T lymphocytes can develop into memory cells. The T helper cells coordinate and control the immune system. They do this by secreting various neurotransmitters. The B lymphocytes grow in the bone marrow, and when it comes in contact with an infectious substance it recognizes, they are transformed into plasma cells that produce antibodies. (**You could've been a little clearer on how it goes from the first contact of the infectious agent that antibodies are formed, what happens.**)

If we now activate the humoral immune response and produce memory cells, subsequent exposures will provide a huge production of the antibodies to neutralize the antigen, which explains why we could not see any better results during the second injection. The main reason why you only use it in the first blood clot incident is that it is a bacterially derived protein and can lose its effectiveness quickly. I believe that the second injection can not be administered shortly after the first to streamline the thrombolytic effect of streptokinase.",Need help on knowing what I should elaborate on in my answer (on immune system)

biology,"For the analysis of this experiment (method in link): [https://imgur.com/a/l9HuHYd](https://imgur.com/a/l9HuHYd) 

My teacher said that I do not meet the full criteria below for an A, namely this:

“Your analysis of several of the sources of error is relevant, accurate and good. You analyze what is relevant in the task and do not drift away to include parts that are not relevant.""

You can ask me if anything doesn't make sense, or need me to clarify on anything (I translated from Swedish to English). Also, in the method list, 2. should say ”Cut the potato in six equal bits”.

**Her comments are also in bold.** My answer is below:

I wrote that the results show that the volume of the potato bits increases when they are in lukewarm water, and decreases when they are in a sugar solution. It can be said that the potato is then a living plant tuber that is made up of cells, and that in these cells there is water that contains solutes. These cells also have a cell wall that has a characteristic feature where it is semipermeable, i.e. semi-permeable and can let through water molecules **(It is true that potato cells have cell walls but here I think you mix the cell wall with the cell membrane (inside the cell wall, plant cells have cell membrane) Thus, it is the cell membrane that is semipermeable.).** When placing the potatoes in a sugar solution, water can migrate in or out of the potatoes by diffusion.

Some terms that are important to master are diffusion and osmosis here, because osmosis is the process where concentration differences of different substances are evened out by diffusion. There is also osmotic water potential. More specifically, osmosis is that which occurs through molecules, ions, or atoms. What happens is that these constituents move through the semipermeable membrane that is inside the cells. Diffusion does not need energy to make an impact.

Furthermore, the sucrose solution has less percent water than the potatoes. Due to osmosis, the water in the potatoes will be in equilibrium with the sucrose concentration. If the concentration of sucrose is low in the solution, the mass of the potatoes will be reduced less because the solution has a higher concentration of water than sucrose. I can imagine that potato bits 1-3 increased their density in the sugar solution, because they float but eventually increase the density. Why the potato bits float is because they had a lower density than the sugar solution. Density is the ratio of mass to volume. In the sugar solution, the cells of the potato bits are hypertonic and lose their water molecules, which explains why its volume decreased.

Regarding potato bits 4-6 that were present in the lukewarm water, the hypotonic solution (high water concentration), their cytoplasm contains a lower concentration of water than its surroundings, which in turn means that a diffusion occurs to equalize the water concentrations between the lukewarm water and the potato bits. cytoplasm. Small uncharged water molecules pass through the cell membranes of the potato bits without problems, which causes the cells to ""swell up"" and the volume of the potato increases due to the fact that it is in the hypotonic solution.

Essentially, potato bits contain potato cells with semipermeable membranes, and potato cells are, in other words, plant cells with cell walls. The cell walls are made up of cellulose and polysaccharides that help the cell maintain a certain shape, and prevent the cells from cracking due to osmosis. The potato's plant cells use active protein pumps to pump in ions.

Possible sources of error with this experiment are if the water or sugar solution may have been spilled during the laboratory, which in turn can also affect the measurements performed and lead to an incorrect answer. Then it can also be a question of how concentrated the sugar solution is, which does not give us a nuanced picture of how the process itself works, so you could need to perform several experiments to get more results and draw a conclusion from it. Thus, it is best to do several experiments for a more reliable result, with different potato bits, in order to then obtain an average value and the like. Other sources of error I can think of are the size of the potato cubes, that you have not made measurements of the masses on the potato bits before and after the experiment, that you may not have dried the potato bits before weighing and the experiment. It is therefore best to use a kitchen scale with good measurement accuracy to include the valuable value figures, digital instruments are best for that matter. You could also use a cork drill for the experiment for the potatoes.","Need help on knowing what I should elaborate on in my answer (on osmosis, analysis of methodology on experiment)"

I theorize that this is because of hormones absorbed by the penis, not just psychologically. Has this been posited by others?

Please let me know if there is a better sub for this; I'm new to reddit. Thanks :)","I'm wondering if during sex, males absorb chemicals from the vagina through their penises."

biology,"I need help on what I should improve on in my answer to the question below, since **my teacher commented with bold on what I should elaborate on.** She said the reason I didn't get an A on the assignment was because I didn't answer the question and explain the details, and that I didn't use correct and relevant terminology throughout.

&gt;1. How do hormones work and in what respects are they important? Integrate relevant examples into your explanation.

1.Hormones are chemical messengers that go through the body and coordinate complex processes such as growth, metabolism and fertility. Hormones can affect the function of the immune system and even change the behavior of humans. Before birth, the hormones lead to the development of the brain and reproductive system, and the hormones are the reason why arms become the same length, so you can turn food into fuel in the form of energy and ATP and the transition from child to adult through puberty.

It happens as if a signal is sent to the brain to secrete hormones into the blood through the glands that produce and store these hormones. In turn, these glands form the so-called endocrine system. Chemicals that interfere with the function of hormones are therefore called endocrine disorders. Then we also have the testicles and ovaries, or ""gonads"", are perhaps the most famous endocrine glands. In men, the testicles produce sperm and secrete the male sex hormone testosterone; in women, the ovaries produce eggs and the female hormone estrogen. It is these hormones that determine secondary sex characteristics such as muscle mass and facial hair. They also help orchestrate sperm production, menstruation and pregnancy. Other endocrine glands include the thyroid gland, the islands of the pancreas and the adrenal glands. These are mainly involved in growth, metabolism and ""fight or flight"" responses to stress.

While all cells are exposed to hormones circulating in the bloodstream, not all cells respond. Only the ""target"" cells of a hormone, which have receptors for that hormone, will respond to its signal. When the hormone binds to its receptor, it causes a biological response in the cell. If we resemble a hormone with a radio signal, a receptor is the antenna. Without the antenna wouldno signal is received and no music would leave the radio. The signaling stops when the circulating hormones are broken down and secreted by the body.

Then there are also endocrine disruptors that can affect the hormone signal pathway. Some are hormone-like: they bind the receptor and send a false signal - one that has not come from the brain. Other endocrine disruptors block the effect that a natural hormone should have, and prevent it from binding to the receptor and creating an effect. Endocrine disorders can also change the amount of hormone that is synthesized, how quickly it is broken down or how a target cell should react. All of these mechanisms of action can create the same effect, for example, interfering with the development of an embryo or causing an altered function in an adult.

**What happens when the hormone level is adequate or even needs to be reduced or completely changed? Is there anything called negative feedback, also, could you explain what is meant by that?**

But if we are to give real examples of how hormones affect us, it is quite simple. If we take an example of a hormone that can affect our hunger, it is the hormone ghrelin, which gives the brain the signal that it is time for food. Another hormone, leptin, sends a signal to the brain that you do not need to consume because you are already full on your stomach. The thyroid gland creates hormones that help control metabolism, and contribute to how quickly the body converts food into nutrients and energy. When the gland does not make enough of these hormones, it is called hypothyroidism. A symptom of this is usually an unexplained weight gain, and I know this because I know an individual with this disease who had this explained to him by a doctor. Of course, a weight gain is not optimal for the individual and one must seek treatment from the doctor immediately.",Need help on knowing what I should elaborate on in my answer (on hormones)

biology,"Hi all, I'm an undergrad currently doing a summer internship with a bioinformatics group. My internship project is based on getting a new analysis technique to work on the group's system and using it to analyse some data the group has collected, as well as using this pre-existing technique to develop a novel technique. So far, I've been working on replicating the results of the original paper on the technique, and so far I've managed to get everything working. 

Last week, I told my supervisor and the group leader in a meeting that I'd finished setting up this analysis tehcnique on our server and I was ready to move on to the next step. However, instead of letting me move on to developing the novel technique, my supervisor instead told me that that part of the project was being given over to someone else in the group to 'avoid conflict', and instead suggested I work on something else. I didn't really process it at the time so I just said okay, but thinking back I feel like this was pretty unfair, since I'm the only person in the group working on this technique and the novel technique that I was originally going to work on is (I think) far more interesting and impactful than this new thing that I've been given. My question is, is this kind of situation normal in research environments? I'd really rather prefer to work on the original idea, but I'm not sure how to raise this issue with the supervisor or group leader (or even if it's appropriate to do so), or whether there would be any point in doing so.",What to do about internship project being taken over by someone else?

biology,"Hello, beneath the quote I have written my answers to the separate questions, but my teacher said that it only warranted the grade D. This is high school biology, so keep that in mind. What did I get wrong? What should I've elaborated on more?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;1. What happens during anaerobic metabolism? This happens, for example, in your muscles when they are allowed to work intensively.

Under oxygen-free conditions, glycolysis is used, which in turn is used by muscle cells. During glycolysis, glucose is broken down into pyruvic acid, giving 2 ATP for each glucose molecule. When muscle cells break down glucose anaerobically, we call this lactic acid fermentation, and fermentation means that you, not completely, oxidize substances that are organic and all this takes place without access to oxygen. For glycolysis to work, you need a hydrogen carrier, NAD+, which captures hydrogen and creates NADH, which means that NAD+ is important during anaerobic work. The muscle cells can produce lactic acid from the pyruvic acid by using NADH to produce NAD+ again. During physical exertion, for example, the body needs oxygen because it collects too much lactic acid, and the muscle cells need more oxygen to burn the formed lactic acid.

&gt;2. A plant cell is placed in seawater. What happens to the cell and why?

Since this is osmosis, it can happen that the plant cell dies if you place the cell in seawater with a high concentration of salt, then the cytoplasm has a greater content of water than its surroundings, which means that water goes out and the cell shrinks and dries.

&gt;3. An animal cell is placed in distilled water. What happens to the cell and why?

An explosion occurs as a result of the combination of water in the cell. Equalization of ion, atom/molecule in/and outside the cell concentration will occur as a result of the inflow of water, the process is called osmosis. There are no ions in distilled water, this leads to an explosion in the animal cell with respect to the inflow of water as there are dissolved ions (aq), and uncharged molecules in a living cell.

&gt;4. Explain how a cell membrane is constructed and what properties this entails.

The cell membranes demarcates themselves from the fluid around them, and have the task of regulating substances that come in and out of the cell membrane. The cell membranes help holding cells together in the tissue of the body. Cell membranes consist of lipids, and in particular phospholipids, as well as proteins of various kinds. On the glycol lipids and proteins, there is something called sugar rings which are carbohydrates and these are what gives an outer layer to the cell membranes, these protect the cell membranes together with water. Cholesterol is also counted as lipids in cell membranes. The head of the phospholipids dissolves in water and is polar hydrophilic, while the tails are non-polar fat chains and do not dissolve in water but can dissolve in each other.","Need help elaborating on my answers to this homework questions (photosynthesis, anaerobic metabolism, etc.)"

biology,"Hello, fellow biologists. I just want to know the international opinion on this particular topic, and to ask for your support. In my country, Paraguay, there is a law the prohibits a biologist to work in certain areas. The article 14 of the Biochemist Law stipulates that only a person with a biochemist degree can be the technical director of a laboratory. In addition, the article 7 establishes functions for biochemists, some of which overlap with functions of other professionals (including biologists), and article 19 declares that those who perform those functions without having the undegraduate degree of biochemist incur in the illegal exercise of that profession. 

With so many specialization aspects of our career, it is natural that the community of biologists share workspaces with various types of professionals, for example with veterinarians, agronomists, biochemists and biotechnologists. In some cases, depending on the specialization that the biologist has, we even perform some similar functions, but always with a different professional perspective. I'm sure we all know this.

In Paraguay, 3 out of 4 biologists seek specialization after the undergraduate degree. We have so many examples of biologists who came back from the States, Brazil, Argentina to name a few, with PhDs and experience who cannot be held in higher positions than a simple undergraduate. For example, biologist Walter Sandoval, who has an undergrad degree from the National University of Paraguay, holds a master's degree and a doctorate in microbiology from North Carolina State University. Upon completing his doctorate, he went on to work as a postdoctoral researcher at the prestigious Harvard University. Walter has extensive experience in microbial physiology and industrial applications of microbiology, especially bioprocesses and fermentation. If we needed the expertise of Dr. Sandoval to lead a laboratory of the Ministry of Health or Agriculture, as soon as he tried to apply for the position, he would discover that he cannot participate in it. Likewise, if an industry wanted to take advantage of its valuable knowledge in industrial applications of microbiology, and wanted to appoint it as technical director of a laboratory, he would be legally unable to do so.

Logically, we elaborated a Biologist bill. The purpose of the this bill, drawn up by the College of Biologists of Paraguay, is to regulate the exercise of the profession of a biologist. It defines areas of action for professionals in biology, describes functions that a biologist can develop in different fields, and establishes their rights and obligations. The Biologist's bill does not propose exclusivity for biologists when performing these functions, it simply seeks that biologists are not prohibited from carrying out their tasks because some of them coincide with those of other professionals. Seeks that the constitutional right to decent and fair work under conditions of equality is not ignored. 

We are currently facing a considerable amount of backlash from the biochemist community because of this bill. They feel threatened for some reason, in no way does this bill intend that biologists appropriate the areas of action of other professionals. Nor does it enable biologists to perform functions for which they are not prepared, but rather seeks to eliminate a legal void and allow our right to exercise the profession. The problem is that we are a very corrupt country and anything can happen here, which is very sad.

biology,"I am working on an assignment, and I will [criticize the sources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_criticism) I have used. I would appreciate help on how I can improve my report. My sources are these:

* Encyclopaedia Britannica
* Sciencedirect
* National Resource Center for Biology and Biotechnology
* Björn, L. O., &amp; Bergström, J., (2008). Evolution of the photosynthesis process. Swedish Botanical Journal
* Karlsson, J., Krigsman, T., Molander, B-O., Wickman, P-O., Björndahl, G. (2012). Biology 2nd ed. 4., Solna, Liber.

How would you critically review these sources and assess the credibility of the statements made in these sources? Source criticism is a central scientific method for assessing which information from an informant is credible. Criteria for source criticism are usually:

1. Authenticity = Is the source what it claims to be? Original or copy? Genuine or fake?
2. Time = When was the source established? Is the information up to date? Has anything happened since then that affects the subject?
3. Dependence = Is the source independent, or is it related to / based on other sources? What sources?
4. Tendency = Are there values ​​in the information? Whose interest is represented? What does the sender really want?

For Encyclopaedia Britannica, I wrote that the source is slightly worse than the previous sources because, at Britannica, it is an encyclopedia with editors who write in these and reproduce facts from other sources and compile it on one page. Admittedly, I could have chosen another source, for example, the school book from Janne Karlsson, but it did not contain essential information, which meant that I had to search with the help of Google to find what I was looking for.

For Björn, L. O., et al., I wrote that it is an academic essay with a scientific basis for shedding light on the evolution of the photosynthesis process and explaining how it all works. The author in question is a professor.

For Karlsson, J., et al., I wrote that that source is used because it is a book that is distributed to high school students for them to read through for their studies. Therefore, I trust that the information provided on it is correct. Maybe a bit outdated because it is from 2012, and researchers sometimes make new findings that require the information in the coursebook to be updated.

For the National Resource Center for Biology and Biotechnology, I wrote that I chose this source then, if you look at their ''about us'' page, it says this: '' Bioresurs started in 2002 with a national assignment from the Ministry of Education and Uppsala University to support teachers who teach NO/biology throughout the school. The overall goal for Bioresurs is to contribute to teachers in preschool, school, and adult education, gaining increased competence and increased interest in biology and biotechnology. Through the efforts of teachers, students are given increased opportunities for current and interesting teaching.""

For Sciencedirect, I wrote that Sciencedirect is a website that offers membership-based access to a broad database of scientific and medical research. To this end, it can probably be said that the source objectively presents factual information. Therefore, I assumed that what is written there is based on science that is in demand for this task. The author's knowledge of the subject-matter can also be found out when the name of the author is included, who has written the information itself.  
Sciencedirect includes all information, and only omits information if you do not pay for the service. Because ""Solar Energy Conversion Systems"" was the book written by Jeffrey R.S. Brownson on the website, and that book was released in 2013, it may be that new findings are available on the subject. The reason I went for the secondary source, in this case, was because the information was available to me to read through when I did not have access to the book. Jeffrey R.S. Brownson has a doctorate in environmental chemistry and technology. From the perspective of the dependency criterion, it can be stated that Sciencedirect is a source that is dependent on researchers to offer research to readers. Brownson is not said to be the last researcher on the subject. It is thus a reliable source if you take this into account and want to provide objective facts.",Need help with source criticism

In a tour de force of metabolic engineering, Prashanth Srinivasan and [Christina Smolke at Stanford](https://bioengineering.stanford.edu/people/christina-smolke) have engineered baker’s yeast to produce tropane alkaloids. These compounds, which are normally extracted from nightshade to treat neuromuscular disorders, were biosynthesized from starting sugars and amino acids. Constructing the synthetic pathway required more than twenty distinct proteins-taken from yeast, bacteria, plants and animals-targeted to six sub-cellular compartments, to produce the medicines. The study was published in *Nature* and has been widely covered in the media, including as a *Nature* [story](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02461-8) and in a [Stanford press release](https://news.stanford.edu/2020/09/02/scientists-turn-yeast-cells-drug-factories/).

In that paper, they described the [efficient, accurate assembly of 24 DNA fragments](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.8b00333) in a single tube. Now, many of those same authors have built upon their prior study, reporting the routine assembly of **35 DNA fragments** in a single reaction. To optimize the system, the authors used DNA sequencing to explore possible combinations of restriction enzymes, and then “incorporated these findings into a suite of webtools” to design more efficient DNA assembly reactions.

A new study in *Nature Communications* reports that liposomes-basically sacs of phospholipids that enclose water-can be packed and programmed with a genetic blueprint. Liposomes were packaged with a loop of DNA encoding seven different genes, together comprising a biosynthetic pathway to build phospholipids. By using “fluorescence-based probes”, the researchers were able to “directly visualize membrane incorporation of synthesized phospholipids at the single vesicle level”-in other words, miniature cells, with miniature genetic programs, can help build themselves.

Promoters are short sequences of DNA upstream of a gene that play a major role in determining *how much* of a protein is produced. But the rules underpinning promoters, and a gene’s expression level, have proven difficult to unravel. This week, the [Patron lab](https://www.earlham.ac.uk/nicola-patron) reported an experimental system to rigorously investigate how different traits in a promoter-its sequence and positioning of regulatory elements, for example-impact the expression level of a gene. With these findings, a suite of “minimal” promoters were developed that can be used to more precisely tune a gene’s output. The study was published in *Nucleic Acids Research*.

[Software Package Simplifies Inter-Lab Measurements](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00296) (Open Access)

The International Genetically Engineered Machine competition, or [iGEM](https://igem.org/Main_Page), has brought together young synthetic biology students for nearly two decades. A cornerstone of that competition is the [measurement ](https://2020.igem.org/Measurement)lab, whereby students carefully measure engineered cells and report their results to study how those measurements differ across laboratories and devices. A new study, in *ACS Synthetic Biology*, builds upon the dire need for standardization in synthetic biology, offering a software tool (written for R) that can calibrate fluorescent and plate reader measurements.

biology,"Hey, I need help with the methodology of this experiment.

**The methodology**

For an experiment where a cup is filled with water, which has been open for at least one hour, add 0.5–1 g of bicarbonate and a few drops of detergent to the water. Then the cut stem of pondweed was arranged so that it would stand upside down in the cup. Then the tip was dropped down with paper clips.

&gt;Continued. with A and B:  
A: T**he effect of the amount of light: The laboratory had been darkened, and the pondweed was illuminated at a distance of ten centimeters with ordinary light for about 3 minutes for the plant to adapt. Then the number of bubbles that the plant emitted for 3 minutes was counted. The procedure was repeated for the following distances: 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and 70 cm. The result was recorded in a table.**  
B: The same method is done for this experiment as in 1-3. This time\*\*, the pondweed was illuminated for 3 minutes at a distance of 10 cm with different light sources. First started with the I) blue lamp then II) the red lamp and finally III) the green lamp.\*\*

In response to my constructive critique of the methodology on the experiment, and some suggestions on improvements:

&gt;One method is to use a carbon dioxide meter to measure the carbon dioxide in the air to know how much concentration there is of it in the area that the experiment is performed in, (m**y teacher comments here: this experiment was performed in cups with water where bicarbonate was added for the plant to obtain carbon dioxide**). It was a good idea to note the temperature in the room.

My teacher writes: You could better link the discussion about things that may have affected the result to what has been done in this particular laboratory. Here I could reason about, e.g.:

• The plant may have been impacted by previous measurements, which means that more bubbles will form during the first test.

• Can you be sure that the light source only contains blue, red and green wavelengths, respectively?

• There may be errors when counting the bubbles, these may be easy to miss or several smaller bubbles may have merged into one large one.

• Can we be sure that the amount of carbon dioxide in the water is sufficient?

These are apps (really web-apps) that I've made for my own class or other teachers I know. They are mostly for physics because that's what I teach but there are a good number of life science ones too. They run on any internet-connected device that isn't tooooo old. They are all free and will always be free.

**Who are you?**

I am a science teacher in the Chicago Public Schools. I've been teaching physics for the past 7 years but will be teaching a mix this year. I have also have a minor biology and have taught it a little bit way back when.

**Why now?**

I've been sitting on these, some of them for years. I've always wanted other people to be able to use them but I've always been to lazy to make it happen. I've played around with the idea of making a start up but with so many kids needing to learn science outside of the lab this year I knew now was the time. 

I've posted on /r/ScienceTeachers and /r/physics before so you might have seen my stuff there but I've noticed some of my life science apps like the bug in meadow sim are popular so I thought /r/biology might like them too. 

**What've you got for me?**

The apps are sorted by how you might use them. I want to help as many students as possible get a high-quality three-dimensional science education. The apps will always be free.

I'm putting the biology/life science ones here. If you want to see other content areas you can find them here:

Link to all [bio apps](https://whscience.org/biology.html) - [chem apps](https://whscience.org/chemistry.html) - [earth&amp;space apps](https://whscience.org/earthspace.html) - [physics apps](https://whscience.org/physics.html)

### Virtual Labs/Phenomena
These replicate something like you would get with a hands on lab. Students can change things and see final velocities. 

[Bug In Meadow](https://whscience.org/buginmeadow/) - **Biology** - Replicates the common Bead Bug activity. click/tap the bugs on a meadow to eat half of them. Click ""count"" to see how many of each color survived and then have them reproduce. After several generations you see strong selection pressure based on the colors in th meadow. This is one of the first I made so it looks janky but it works better than any actual beads and cloth version I've seen. 

[Onion Root Tip Slides](https://whscience.org/onionroot/index.html) - **Biology** - Shows onion root tip slides. Start with a macro picture of green onions and zoom in on two roots at 40x and 100-400x. Slides are chosen to show stages of mitosis clearly. Big thank you to [Berkshire Community College Bioscience Image Library](http://blogs.berkshirecc.edu/bccoer/) for releasing their microscopy photos in the public domain. 

### Measurement or Problems
Think of these as virtual practice problems. Students make measurements and calculate or figure something out. 

[Bacteria Plate Streaking](https://whscience.org/streaking/) - **Biology** - Students practice the procedure of streaking a plate to isolate a bacteria culture. Heavy inspired by [this excellent simulation](http://learn.chm.msu.edu/vibl/content/streakplate.html) out of Michigan State University that unfortunately doesn't work well for remote learning because it requires  flash. A request of my wife's. 

[Gel and Restriction Enzymes](https://whscience.org/gelre/) - **Biology** - An old request of my wife's - Two simulations. The first is using restriction enzymes without sticky ends. The second is moving DNA segments a la gel electrophoresis. Keeps track of how many you have done. 

[Transcription and Translation](https://whscience.org/transcriptiontranslation/) - **Biology** - Move base pairs around to transcribe off an open DNA sequence and then act as tRNA and bring in the right amino acid using a chart. I'm going to be honest. This app is so old I don't really remember making it but I tested it out and it seems to work fine. 

### Diagram Makers
Sometimes it's easier for me to make an app once rather than make 100 versions of a diagram.

[Blood Pressure Diagram](https://whscience.org/bpdiagram/) - **Biology** - A request of my wife's - Shows the dial on an analog sphygmomanometer. Can show systolic and diastolic side by side or on the same dial. Use a screenshot to save the image. (Win-PrtScn or Fn-Win-Space on Windows, Shift-Cmd-4 on Mac)

[Pedigree Maker](https://whscience.org/pedigree/) - **Biology** - A request of my wife's - Make pedigree diagrams by dragging the pieces around. Double click to select a piece. Use a screenshot to save the image. (Win-PrtScn or Fn-Win-Space on Windows, Shift-Cmd-4 on Mac)",I've been making apps for my own class for years. Now you can use them too.

People go vegan these days because we either don't want to hurt animals or save the planet or we either think the plants are this amazing holy thing, so for health. The meat and heart attack thing has happen behind and obviously, it's no longer a viable reason for heart disease. We now know it's the combination of meat and many modern unnatural things our bodies aren't evolved to consume so much of, like way excess omega 6, but that's the vegan diet it self. For those who don't want to hurt animals, you're harming insects from spraying plants so much in order to have your plant foods all year and those who want to save the planet, you're just being blind. If you really wanted to save the planet you would've still eaten meat, but only regenerative agriculture based meat. To say cow farts are so bad for the Earth makes no sense. There were, WAY before global warming, 30 to 60 million of buffalo. I'm not that knowledgeable about pollution, but I googled it and there are almost one billion cows on Earth. If there are about 7.5 billion people on Earth, I don't know about you, but I think the problem isn't animals, the problem is the population is SO high. This is a whole other problem that didn't exist before, because people had shorter lives before, but no one wants that, so fixing the birth rate is probably the better solution (my opinion, so don't attack me on it), instead of billions of humans living an unhealthy life eating just plants. I'm not going to go into anti nutrients and micro nutrient problems going vegan and how some nutrients, vegans, eating whole foods can never reach enough of, but I'm mentioning it because of how important it's. Veganism is a terrible diet and every top researcher and nutrition expert believes the same. I don't hate plants, but most plants we can't even eat and almost all plants we CAN eat we shouldn't be eating and almost all animals can be consumed and I believe we should eat them all.

The results were that the average leaves from the violet-violet plant had a much higher rate of oxygen production the the leafs from the violet-green plant.

We also did an acetone and HCL extraction and used a spectrophotometer to show that the violet-violet plant had higher levels of anthocyanins and higher concentration of chlorophyll in their leaves.

Why does more anthocyanin correlate with more chlorophyll? Is it because it has photoprotective ability which stops destruction of chlorophyll? Or is it because of breeding (the violet-violet Coleus is an ornament plant)?",I need help understanding my plant lab findings!

\-Blood cancer is a general term for cancers of the blood, bone marrow, and lymphatic system

\-1 person every 3 minutes, 480 people a day, 175,200 people a year in the US are diagnosed with a type of blood cancer.

\-Leukemia (cancer in blood and marrow), Lymphoma (cancer of lymphatic system), and Myeloma (cancer of plasma cells) are the 3 main types of blood cancers

\-For many patients, a bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant may cure them, and this may come from family members or unrelated volunteers. About 30% of people in need have a matching family member, however that means that 70% of people need to look for unrelated volunteers to donate.

\-Don't worry about the myths of bone marrow transplants. About 80% of donors donate peripheral blood stem cells similar to a platelet donation. The other 20% donate bone marrow cells from the hip under sedation and is relatively painless with mild soreness at worst.

\-Recipients that are part of a minority group have the hardest time finding a donor on the registry. Only 25% of black or multi-racial patients will have a donor on the registry, 40% of Asian-American, and 45% of Hispanic/Latinx. Their best chance is finding someone with a similar ethnic background.

\-There is a 1 in 200 chance you will be called as a potential match and 1 in 5 potential matches will be asked to donate.

I've personally joined the bone marrow registry seeing how simple it might be to save someone's life in exchange for a quick procedure. If you're interested in starting a Gift of Life program just dm me!",Want to save a life? Want to give back? Consider donating bone marrow!

&gt;**Abstract**  
&gt;  
&gt;It is generally assumed that DNA structure has been solved by Watson-Crick in 1953. However, the finding of zero linking number topoisomer indicated that the winding direction inside the double helix should be ambidextrous, rather than plectonemic. Hence, a double helix conjecture was proposed that in any kind of plasmid a zero linking number topoisomer, i.e., a non-linked plasmid could be found. By denaturing and renaturing plasmid in various different ways, the topological transformation of the DNA was observed by agarose gel electrophoresis. We found that the two strands of a covalently closed circular DNA molecule can be completely dissociated under very mild conditions and this dissociation is reversible. The experimental phenomena indicated that two strands of DNA are unlikely winding right-handedly as in the canonical double helix model. It paves the way for the demonstration of the double helix conjecture which would provide solid evidence to amend the Watson-Crick Model.

2018 - [Recent progress in double helix conjecture](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XfQTt4V3dF4_dPfOLI_0htnilsEu7wT_/view?usp=sharing)

It's a very curious paper. The author, You Cheng Xu, has been interested with plasmid topology since the 1980s ([here's the first paper I've found concerning this](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jTAMGVOsnX3ZX9jJNPpgQnCQ4bMm3KHw/view?usp=sharing)).

Xu last published [Evidence Falsifying the Double Helix Model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TJoI5Pvw_In9wwFanZTEhPm-hH2TjETE/view?usp=sharing)

biology,"Hey guys I have been thinking about how DNA works. I have been thinking about the question, and I kind of came with some theories on what happens, but I wanted to know what are researches and expert knowledge that's out there.  


I myself am a Computer Programmer, like many people working in IT industry.. I recently watched a Netflix documentary, I think it was called Human Nature, it was about Crispr. So, I started thinking DNA is as a black box program... I came up with this concept of tracers... I don't know if its something that's already discovered and known or I am wrong, hence I am asking this question... But I wanted to also share my rationale on it... So what I know is mostly all cells in the human body have the same DNA code which is generating different proteins that activate other stuff and perform tasks in the body.. Now Each cell in the body with the same DNA code is producing different proteins and transforming into different specialized cells, So I believe, they are executing different parts of DNA code in different types of cells. This also means that these cells have got the information of where in the body they are located and based on this information they are executing certain parts of DNA. As cells are chemical phenomena, this information must be stored in some chemical structure. This information itself is what I have been calling tracer.  


I think there are two ways of how cells achieve this information,  

1. Tracking the information from the embryo. I.e. the first cells that divide into an embryo is sharing information of the position of these cells after division, to know exactly where they are and what they will be doing... 

2. Communication of information by some chemical, I.e. the cells are producing some chemical to provide information to other cells, wherein the body they are...  


Adding on top of my unproven probably crazy believes, I believe as we get old these tracers start to lose their strength and the cells start to forget what form they are supposed to manifest.

Also, I think mastery of these tracers will equip us with technology to mix different known cells, organs, and systems in creatures to form a custom creature based on our needs. Maybe, we will be able to produce grass or trees that fire neurons to produce electricity for houses...  


I have only rendered this much of theory in my thoughts right now. I have started to think, but haven't completely deciphered the following part, but I believe that Actions does convert your DNA, make the mutation.. i.e. it is not the one way street of DNA forming body, but the body also forms DNA alteration but perhaps over the generations. I.e. The sperm or ovaries contain information not only of the DNA that they received from their parent but probably also information on different changes that they went through in their lifetime. And tracer has a role to play in this part as well. But I am no expert, I was just thinking about it and ask good people of  the internet to enlighten me on the subject.","If DNA in every cell of the body is the same, why the cells are different?"

biology,"In this biology project I’m researching a macromolecule and the possible structural or environmental changes that could happen. I found a article about the denaturation of a protein specifically prion. And in this protein tyr 128 is bonded to asp 178, and in the presence of alcohol it disrupts the hydrogen bonding between these two, effecting the shape. 

However, the first part of this project requires me to draw a diagram on my chosen macromolecule, in which I would need to label monomers, polymers, and any sorts of bonds. But I’m not sure how I would go about labeling this, would I be expected to find a diagram of Prion? And if so I haven’t been able to find anything about the function. I could answer the middle questions, where I’d be described how the environment alters the structure of the protein as it’s included in the article, and I’d also be able to give a drawing. But the last question asks how does the change in structure affects its function; I am aware every little change in a proteins structure could alter or render it biologically inactive, but I’m not sure this is the case.

biology,"I mean they are stronger than the average human, but not by 5 but 2. People keep saying there 10 times stronger but that's about gorilla's strength, speaking of gorillas, they think they can rip the face off and defeat a gorilla... like what!

I remember someone saying a 3 foot 60 pound chimp can absolutely destroy a 452 pound hafthor who's 6'9 because a 60 lb chimp can lift 1000 lbs,(Looking at you Xp3r, who commented on the fascinating hairless chimpanzees video) they can't but i can see a 200 pound chimp doing it. Speaking of which they keep bringing up the story of the woman that got her faced ripped. The thing is the chimp was 200 lbs so it's stronger than the average chimp, you can't compare and average chimp to a 200 pound chimp, and that woman was also old with weaker bones and skin. Same thing with that mane that got his nose bitten off he was old too.

Pretty much anyone can bite a nose clean off. Also some people think they can rip an arm out and beat you to death with it which they can't even horses of trouble doing that, because to rip an arm out in under a split second you need over 30,000 lbs of force even a gorilla can't do that quickly, that's why tug-a-war is dangerous and if a multiple chimpanzee's or gorilla's did that and the rope snapped there arms would be ripped out. And the face incident people keep ignoring that the chimp used it's teeth in that situation.

Also in fights they never seem to think a strong person that can lift over 1000 lbs can go for the eyes of the chimp and fight dirty, and when people and also keep mentioning they can go and jam there hands to the eyes people ignore it and don't even answer the question and think about what happens when there stabbed in the eye.

Some people think they can still kill someone when they are stabbed in the brain, or they can survive a sledgehammer to the skull, like a sledge hammer has a force of over 2,500 lbs like are they saying they can surive 1.25 tons of force to the face, a sledge hammer can even damage a elephant skull. And people are saying chimpanzee can flip a 3000 lbs car over, i can see gorilla doing it but not a chimpanzee.

Some people even think a 7 pound chimp can beat all Olympic records and lift over 1100 lbs like then that would mean there much stronger than a gorilla. Also it's been proven that a trained strong human can kill a big animal with a needle or knife that includes a chimpanzee. Some people think they can walk off a slit damaged throat and a stab to the heart, they can't.

I won't deny they have sharp teeth and that's one of those weapons born there are some humans stronger than a chimp and have stronger grip strength then a chimp like dennis rogers who stopped 2 airforce t-34 airplanes from taking off and Tommy heslep who did the same thing but with hand.

So yeah don't overrate chimps, especially if you saying there stronger than a gorilla.",Why do people overrate chimp strength?

biology,"Hello everyone! To keep it brief, I'm leaving my comfortable job as a land surveying technician to go back to college and pursue my dreams of being a wildlife biologist. It's what I've always wanted to do, and I'll do anything to pursue it. My wife and I have agreed that we are 100% down to move wherever my work may take us one day, and we're pretty excited. I've been doing A LOT of reading about what you can actually do with a master's in wildlife biology, and it seems like the job market these days has a lot of jobs which are basically conducting wildlife research for construction / development of a location. 

I'm just curious to see if my land surveying experience would be useful or wanted in this field. I've been a drafter / survey technician with a really good company for a few years now. I have extensive experience using GIS systems, GPS systems, reading and writing legal documents, and drafting jobs from start to finish. We work primarily in the cell service and subdivision industry, so I have a strong fundamental understanding of property boundaries, setbacks, easements, reading maps and plats, and the general procedure of developing a site from woodlands eventually to a completed cell phone tower or subdivision.

Which is exactly why I'm leaving the surveying field. I've realized that I cannot live the rest of my life selling my soul to work on a computer, help destroy nature, and make businessmen happy. I grew up in nature, with old fashioned parents who raised me outside, gardening, hunting, fishing, camping, hiking, and working my ass off from sun up to sun down. I'll be damned if I'm going to waste my one and only life doing work that doesn't fulfill my soul or bring any satisfaction to my life. It's my dream to eventually become a researcher of some kind, and conduct research for the betterment of our planet, but I know that I will probably end up working a few, or a lot, of jobs until that point. Even if I end up working in the development industry like I'm in now, at least I'll be the guy who's telling the company they can't build here because of an endangered species. It's going to be a reslly hard and difficult road, but that's what makes it interesting. My wife and I are really beginning to hate the semi 'comfortable' life style we have now, and we can't wait to shake things up.",Will having extensive knowledge in land surveying be helpful for finding a wildlife biology job in the future?

I’ve chose biology and I’d like to write about something related to meiotic failures, non-disjunction etc. 

Questions:
1) Do you think it’s a good topic for a hs student to write about? I figured it’d be relatively easy to understand but I’d like to hear your opinion on it.

2) Does anyone have an idea for a possible research question? (We need one and since the paper is only supposed to be about 10 pages long it has to narrow the topic down quite a lot).
Should I write about meiotic failures in general or maybe rather in connection to a specific disease? (But then I’d probably end up only briefly mentioning non disjunction as the cause).

I guess the placenta would rip some of the wall off when detaching, but isn’t the placenta already connected somewhat after its vessels pass through the lining?

2. Why do we not reabsorb/shed the rest of the lining outside the implantation site?

We know that sex is biologically determined at conception, but gender is a bit different referring to the roles that each sex conforms to in a society.

2) Psychological differences - very small &lt;90%

3) Cultural/Societal roles - biggest impact on behavior

biology,"My health background: I had a high metabolism throughout my life. I have also been pretty muscular and never had body fat issues in my entire life. I've had a stable mood all my life.

2012 I developed histamine intolerance which forced me in an inflammatory state and I had to pick foods wisely. Nevertheless I haven't had fatigue in all these years either. My metabolism was still high and everything was alright.

Last year I had varicocele surgery with general anesthesia. The surgery went well. What didn't go well was what happened after that.

I noticed within a week that I am anxious. I had ordered blood test lsd to check if I'm good after surgery. An assistant of the doc told me my serum iron is high. Along with my anxietybthatbarose after surgery I thought my serum iron is high and so it might be a good idea to give away some blood. I told the doc to draw around 400 mil of blood within in a time span of two weeks because my energy levels were high.

Anyway, idk if it was this or the surgery, I caught the cold in March. The cold stayed unusually long for about 2 weeks and the fever and nausea did not cease. I had to take ibuprofen to get things under control. Normally in all these 26 years of my life I never had such a strong cold for this long.

After that I have simultaneously realised a growing fatigue. It got worse and worse over the months. I remember attending uni in April 2019 and felt the need to lie down all the time because I was extremely exhausted. May June July were worse. I was taking supplements to be able to stand on my feet. Chromium Magnesium Zinc etc. My body went from 83 kilos and a ton of muscle to a state of 77 kilos, almost zero fat and exposed muscles. I I bought clothes that dont fit me now anymore.
IT WAS AS IF MY BODY WAS TRYING TO KEEP MY METABOLISM UP AT THE COST OF MY BLOOD PRESSURE I.e.adrenal hormones such as cortisol.

After August my metabolism started to slow down. I started gaining weight but no longer felt the urge to lie down constantly. My body temperature went lower, blood.pressure.became lower. I became slower in general. From september to April 2020 I pretty much spent months mostly sleeping and wondering what the hell happened to me.

Blood work didnt show abnormalities. Iron levels normal. But circulating iron dropped to half of what it has been my entire life. Thyroid normal.

I tried to figure out what drives my fatigue and after a lot if research talking to my doc and trial and error we think that my cortisol has gotten out of control. But why?",I suspect that a surgery from last year sent my body to cortisol overdrive and left me fatigued ever since

biology,"Hi, Everyone!
I’ve been following this sub for some time, and this is my first time posting. 

I have recently had some concerns about my future. I am an  undergrad 1 semester in, and I wanted to know more about my future possibilities, or more specifically, tips that you might have that are difficult to find elsewhere. 

While I do like money, I can abandon a wealthy life for a more fulfilling career. That said, I would like to have some form of stability in life and not have to worry about my next meal. 

I want to at least get my masters degree, but I am thinking whether or not I should pursue a doctorate and possibly become a professor at a decent university. 
I am at a quite-okay university in South Korea, namely Kyunghee University. I have both interest in the subject and I am willing to work for my goals. Despite that, I frequently hear that it is incredibly hard to become a professor, unless you are from one of the top three universities in my country. 
That said, I am proficient in Korean, English, and German and I am willing to migrate to another country. Would that change anything? (ie. Is it easier or different in such countries to become a doctor/professor?) Is it even worth becoming a doctor? 

Also, I am not yet sure on what kind of field I’d like to work in. I personally like almost all fields from microbiology to paleontology (and even other sciences). While I would like to work in fields such as marine biology, I also don’t want to be serving in restaurants at age 40. What would be a decent interesting, and somewhat “stable-y” paying field? (I am additionally interested and capable in photo/videography, knowledgeable about pc hardware and a little bit about software)

Also I would be very thankful for any other tips or things you have to say!

I'm interested in doing lab work that involves both wet lab and dry lab research. I'd also like to help develop things in biotechnology if that's a possibility. What skills can I pick up to help separate myself from the herd? Would obtaining a concentration or a minor make a difference? The Bachelor programs offered at my school include:

Keep in mind that the discussion was solely around Nicotine itself.

I've researched the types of things this guy was talking about, and it doesn't seem like hes entirely wrong. The guy in aforementioned reddit thread says that Nicotine reduces the ROS ""Radical Oxygen Species"" - It seems that from the abstracts of the studies I've read: as people age they lose NADPH, NADPH is used to make and recycle ROS. The aging process is caused by the mitochondria not having enough NADPH to recycle excess ROS. And Nicotine, by blocking a process called ""Fenton's Reaction"" - Nicotine Stops ""Free Radical Generation"" thus slowing down aging.

That was my understanding of what the guy was saying after an hour of internet research, here are some studies that I looked at to try and understand.

I'm not a smoker, but I am extremely skeptical about what this guy was saying because the motivations for wanting Nicotine to be safe are really clear. (You either sell it, or you want to justify your negative habits.) Whereas the motivations for saying Nicotine is bad are not as clear to me, I guess if you wanted to get a decent amount of citations in the academic world, that could be a motivation, but I don't see many bad-faith motivations for saying that Nicotine itself is bad.

I'm a writer and I have an idea but wanted to see if there was any basis in reality for it. 

Winged humans is a popular trope but the stories I run across don't go into the biology of it (understandably so bc that's not something you really want to bore your readers with). 

One thing I found suggests that humans have smaller shoulder blades in order to make room for secondary shoulder blades for the wings. If this were the case, would the smaller size of the arm shoulder blades result in reduced strength/range of movement? Specifically in the case of sword-wielding? 

My thoughts are that either the size of the bone itself is somehow inhibiting or that because it's smaller the muscles can't attach the same way or as well. 

Although I imagine smaller bone might lead to better flexibility? This leads me to believe that *if* there is any weakness it's because the muscles can't attach the same way. *But then* you have more muscles interconnected for the wings. So does the mere presence of the wings offset the disadvantages to the smaller arm shoulder blades?

Thoughts?

[I can't hand wave this information in the story because it's a major baffling point to one of the scientist characters. The non-winged person is a foretold hero but everyone is wondering why they don't have wings. If a person is born without wings it's like a birth defect. Those people still typically have the bones and/or muscles in the back to support wings but just never grew them. This hero has no trace of secondary shoulder blades or muscles to support wings but the cardiopulmonary systems necessary for high altitude/steep dives and such.

**INTRODUCTION-**

**Hepatitis** is an inflammatory condition of the liver. It is usually caused by a viral infection, but there are other possible causes of hepatitis, including autoimmune hepatitis and hepatitis that occurs as a side effect of drugs, drugs, toxins, and alcohol. Viral hepatitis is an acute and chronic infection with hepatitis A, B, C ,D and E ,chronic active hepatitis and cirrhosis, and these are a significant cause of disease and death in the population. **Hepatocellular carcinoma** (HCC), one of the ten most common cancers worldwide, is closely linked to hepatitis B and is also linked to the hepatitis C virus in several regions of the world, in a word, caused by hepatitis C. Scientists have identified five unique hepatitis viruses and identified them by the letters A, B, C, D and E as already said . Although all of them cause liver disease, they differ significantly.

 

1) **Hepatitis A virus (HAV)** — Classified as hepatovirus, it is a small, symmetrical RNA virus that shares many features of the picornavirus family, is present in the feces of an infected person and is often transmitted through contaminated water or food. Certain sexual practices can also spread HIV. Infections are mostly mild, but HIV infections can be severe and even fatal. Most people in the world are infected with this virus, including poor sanitation. Safe and effective vaccines are available for HIV prevention.

2) **Hepatitis B virus(HBV)**\-member of the Hepadnaviridae group, double-stranded DNA virus. The hepatitis B virus is endemic to the human population and hyperandemic in many parts of the world. HBV can be transmitted from infected mothers to babies at birth or from family members to infants in infancy. Infections can also occur through the transfer of HBV-contaminated blood and blood products, through contaminated injections during treatment, and through the use of injectable drugs. It can occurs through unprotected sexual intercourse . HBV also poses a risk for healthcare workers who have suffered accidental needle stick injuries while caring for infected-HBV patients. Safe and effective vaccines are available for the prevention of the infection caused by HBV.

3) Hepatitis C virus (HCV) -, an enveloped single-stranded RNA virus, is transmitted through contact with infected hepatitis C infected blood. Transfer of HCV-contaminated blood and blood products can occur through contaminated injections during the course of treatment and through the use of injectable drugs. Sexually transmitted infections are also possible, but are much less common. There is no vaccine for HCV.

4) Hepatitis D virus (HDV) — an abnormal, RNA virus, with many similarities to viruses, is an important cause of acute and severe chronic liver damage in many parts of the world. HDV virus infections occur only in those who are infected with HBV. Dual infections with HDV and HBV can lead to more serious diseases and worse outcomes. Hepatitis B vaccines protect against HDV infection.

5) Hepatitis E virus (HIV) — This is another enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus, which shares many biophysical and biochemical properties with Caliciviridae.

The hepatitis E virus is a major cause of major epidemics of acute hepatitis in the Indian subcontinent, Central and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, parts of Africa, and elsewhere. The virus is responsible for high mortality (15–20%), especially during the third trimester of pregnancy. In most cases, the infection occurs through contaminated water or food. HIV is a common cause of hepatitis outbreaks in developing parts of the world and growing as an important cause of the disease in developed countries. Safe and effective vaccines have been developed to prevent HV infection, but they are not widely available.

The rules we all need to follow to keep the liver healthy -  
1. Eating at the right time.  
2. Eating at the same time every day and not keeping too much gap between each eating.  
3. Do some physical exercise regularly.  
4. Abstain from drinking alcohol.  
5. Don’t eat too much outside friend foods i.e. fried foods of hotel restaurant.  
6. Drinking water properly. If we do not drink water properly, the ability of liver to detoxify the body is reduced, so everyone should take water in the right amount everyday.  
6. Regular eating of fruits rich in vitamin C also help to keep the liver healthy.

However, in case of any liver related problems, proper medical advice should be taken.

To this end, I hold M&amp;M duels. Taking two candies between my thumb and forefinger, I apply pressure, squeezing them together until one of them cracks and splinters. That is the “loser,” and I eat the inferior one immediately. The winner gets to go another round.

I have found that, in general, the brown and red M&amp;Ms are tougher, and the newer blue ones are genetically inferior. I have hypothesized that the blue M&amp;Ms as a race cannot survive long in the intense theater of competition that is the modern candy and snack-food world.

 Occasionally I will get a mutation, a candy that is misshapen, or pointier, or flatter than the rest. Almost invariably this proves to be a weakness, but on very rare occasions it gives the candy extra strength. In this way, the species continues to adapt to its environment. 

When I reach the end of the pack, I am left with one M&amp;M, the strongest of the herd. Since it would make no sense to eat this one as well, I pack it neatly in an envelope and send it to M&amp;M Mars, A Division of Mars, Inc., Hackettstown, NJ 17840-1503 U.S.A., along with a 3×5 card reading, “Please use this M&amp;M for breeding purposes.”

I’m certainly not limiting my career options to just bio, but I genuinely enjoy doing research projects, learning about advancements in the field, and reading about what some of the members of this sub do in their jobs, so I’m strongly considering it as a major &amp; eventual career. 

I’ve done research projects at school in the past and won a few awards, so I was planning to cold email labs and see if I could begin to learn how a real lab operates this past summer. Obviously, due to COVID, research labs are unwilling to take on new students, which has been really disappointing.

This sub has been amazing to find new articles from &amp; improve my biology understanding. However, without a way to get real lab experience, I’m struggling to find ways to actually involve myself in the field &amp; improve my skills.

biology,"Hi! 
I recently finished my A-levels in commerce subjects. I scored 3As and I have always been a school topper. However, I feel that I'm more suited to a career in biological sciences primarily because I like the internal mechanisms of the human body. I know this may sound very stupid and illogical to many (switching from commerce to science and not having any idea what will I face). I understand and respect that but I feel that I'm really passionate about it though. Like even when I was in my IGCSE years I really enjoyed learning and researching on biology topics even though I was a commerce student.

I have a few concerns that I wish to share with you all. First of all, I said that I like biology but since I'm quite academically new to it I'm not 100% sure. I read a few biology textbooks and I really like the illustrated part mainly. So is my interest in biology a genuine interest or is it only at a surface level? 
Secondly, I have an option to start my Bsc (hons) in biology from the open university. They don't have any formal requirements although the program is accredited in the UK. I plan to go for a masters in physiology in any university in the UK. Will the degree be worth it in terms of further study and all? 

Thank you and have a nice day",Im planning to switch to biological sciences from commerce background at A-level. I need some feedbacks and advices

1. What happens to glucose as your brain uses it, and what becomes of it after?

2. Since i think the brain has no means to store glucose, does cognition directly correlate to availability of glucose in the body? (If you're starved, will you be dumber than if not?)

3. What will happen if i consume a massive amount of glucose and undergo a mentally challenging task? Will my performance improve compared to if i hadn't (For example tests, studying/learning)?

4. Can any form of sugar provide my brain with glucose? And will different forms of sugar have varying effectiveness?

Because, if not for our ability to emotionally enjoy these things, then we'd have no reason to create them, yes? 

Further, these things which I've described (watching TV, looking at art, listening to music, etc.) don't really benefit our survival. At least, not as much as eating, sleeping, exercising, and curing diseases would. 

So then, why did we (and other animals for that matter) ever develop such feelings and desires? Wouldn't it have been more evolutionarily viable for creatures to focus only on surviving? Especially given that more ""primitive"" creatures like plants and amoebas seem to do so. What went wrong in the process of evolution that made humans so different and so focused on other things?

Sure, emotions may develop out of desires for survival (example: we feel good when we eat because eating allows us to survive), but that doesn't change the fact that they exist and often impede our ability to survive. Why use up your time and energy on making a tasty meal when you could just eat something easy and quick and live another day? Not that tasty food or other emotional pursuits are bad, but I don't understand why we developed to have them.

[**A Cas13-Based Assay Detects SARS-CoV-2**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41551-020-00603-x) **(Open Access)**

Tests for SARS-CoV-2—the coronavirus behind the disease COVID-19—could use some help. Now, a large team from the Vidyasirimedhi Institute of Science and Technology and the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard have developed a [SHERLOCK](https://sherlock.bio/) assay (which uses the Cas13 protein) to detect the RNA in SARS-CoV-2. The researchers collected 154 nasopharyngeal and throat swab samples from Siriraj Hospital, in Thailand, and showed that the assay “was 100% specific and 100% sensitive with a fluorescence readout.” It could detect as little as 42 RNA copies of the virus. The study was published in *Nature Biomedical Engineering*.

[**Multiplexed Genome Editing in Fruit Flies**](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2020/08/24/2004655117) **(Open Access)**

The [Boutros lab](https://www.dkfz.de/en/signaling/boutros_en.html) at Heidelberg University has, for the first time, used Cas12a to edit the fruit fly (*Drosophila melanogaster*) genome. Until now, scientists had only been able to use Cas9. The authors demonstrated that Cas12a from *Lachnospiraceae bacterium*—but not *Acidaminococcus—*were functional in the flies, and that the editing efficiency of the Cas12a protein could be tuned with temperature (with 29°C being the optimal). They were able to target up to 8 genes at once from a single crRNA array, and concluded the paper by reporting a mutated version of the Cas12a protein (D156R) with an improved editing efficiency. The study was published in *PNAS*.

The new gene drive, which was reported in *PNAS*, targets the *cardinal* gene that encodes the red-eye phenotype. The gene drive spread to at least 98% of a population—both males and females—after only 6 to 10 generations in a cage trials, and mosquitoes resistant to the gene drive appeared at a frequency of less than 0.1%.

[**An Intercellular Signaling Toolbox for Cell–Cell Communication**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17993-w) **(Open Access)**

Researchers at the [Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.im.cas.cn/pe/fas/) have created an intercellular signaling “toolbox” that enables engineered cells to communicate with one another with minimal crosstalk. The work, published in *Nature Communications*, includes “biosynthesis gene clusters” that are used to build small signaling molecules within the cells, along with a suite of evolved transcription factors and engineered promoters, to increase the signal efficiency. The team demonstrated their “toolbox” in both yeast and human cells, performing complex bio-computations with up to seven engineered strains.

[**Baker Lab Creates ‘Designer’ Transmembrane Pores**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2646-5)

At the University of Washington’s [Institute for Protein Design](https://www.ipd.uw.edu/), the papers never seem to stop. In another tour de force of computational protein design, the Baker lab has created transmembrane protein pores—made from concentric rings of α-helices—with a high selectivity for specific ions or molecules. A pore with 12 α-helices had a high selectivity for potassium ions, compared to sodium ions, while a pore with 16 α-helices enabled selective passage of biotinylated Alexa Fluor 488, a type of fluorescent dye. The study, published in *Nature*, could open the door for a range of designer channels and pores, with major applications for artificial cells.

[**Cell-Free System Produces Cannabinoids**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41589-020-0631-9)

Why grow cannabis—and pay the exorbitant energy bills—when you could crack open some cells and use enzymes instead? The [Bowie lab](https://bowielab.mbi.ucla.edu/) at the [UCLA-DOE](https://www.doe-mbi.ucla.edu/) Institute has created a cell-free system to produce cannabinoids; only 12 enzymes were needed to convert cheap, organic acids into cannabigerolic acid or cannabigerovarinic acid at a titer of about 0.5 grams per liter. That’s nearly two orders of magnitude higher than yeast-based production. The study, published in *Nature Chemical Biology*, could replace extraction of cannabinoids from plants in the future.

biology,"So I recently bought Campbell's overpriced biology book for a kid. I bought it blindly because everyone and their mum recommended it as the best introductory biology book.

Only after I bought it, I realised that this book does not cover several important topics. It barely discusses stuff like disease prevention, injuries, first aid, diet, steroids... or any other part of biology that is actually useful in everyday life and can cause harm if misunderstood. It does have some info on menstruation, birth control, STD prevention etc. But even that part is not clear enough.

This has been a very expensive purchase, and I am pissed. I will resist ranting tho. This book is not bad. It has chapters on biochemistry and behavioral ecology. And it covers a lot of genetics and evolution. In fact, the Campbell guy seems to be obsessed with genetics. But he ignores may other vital parts of biology.

I took a glance at his ""Essential"" biology book, and even thought it is supposed to be the smaller version of this bigger book, it has much more relevant coverage of nutrition and hormones... as well as more clear info on sexual health. Not much on disease prevention and first aid tho.

So what do I do? I think I should return this book and get Campbell's ""Essential biology with physiology"" book. But which book do I supplement that with for covering the parts that this book omits?",I messed up by buying Campbell's biology book. Desperately need some book to supplement it.

So in a way we only feel deviations from this.

Any help or insight you could give me on this would be greatly appreciated.. 

Bit of background, yesterday I inhaled something through my nose while out walking, don't know if it was a fly or a seed/bud from the trees above me at the time, it happened so quick. I didn't cough from it or anything, but tried forcing one just in case.

Now I'm worried I may develop aspiration pneumonia or some other kind of complication as a result of yesterday's inhalation, which the thought of happening during COVID really freaks me out and kept me up all last night worrying.

But a few days ago I was heartbroken after learning that the vaccine.. isn't a really a vaccine, it's a DNA modifying drug.

https://futurism.com/neoscope/potential-covid19-vaccine-hacks-dna-build-immunity

https://www.fanaticalfuturist.com/2020/04/a-new-prototype-covid-19-vaccine-works-by-literally-hacking-your-dna/

Several WHO articles have said that the DNA could get integrated into your genome or chromosomes, meaning your body would constantly be at war with itself because the antigens would not stop being produced. ie when you have COVID, antigens are there for ~2 weeks. All these antigens cause a build up of inflammation. But what if your body mass produces antigens for months or even years?

This is a brand new type of vaccine never tested long term. We don't know how people's bodies will act 1 year, 5 years, or 20 years down the line. Every other vaccine my friend is familiar with is just a dead or weakened virus. Not literal genetic modification.

After this, I've fallen into a depressive state and I am also very angry. I feel like I've been betrayed. In my frustration I have told my entire family and all my friends about this and all of my friends and family are disgusted after learning about it.

It doesn't seem like a normal vaccine will be released in my friend's country so in essence, a vaccine will never be released. I know about the Thalidomide crisis and how everyone thought it was safe too.

This vaccine is being rushed out in just 1 year and it's a highly experimental type that can integrate into your DNA, cause mutations, cause your cells to go rogue, cause your immune system to chronically attack your tissues, all for a virus that has already pretty much died out in my country and has a death rate of ~0.26%. I am terrified this vaccine will be made mandatory. I don't want my DNA to be forcibly messed with, I want to stay human.

Yes.. ''all medication has risks'' but this is like saying, take a rocket built and tested in just 1 year to fly over the Atlantic, rather than a 737 that has been flying safely for 50 years. ''All air travel has risks'' ...

Is it normal I am so depressed over this? It's all I've been thinking about for the past 3 days and have not been able to sleep well because of it (I have Zopiclone and Temazapam sleeping pills).. in fact I had some dreams where I woke up and police broke into my room to force me to get this vaccine that alters your DNA and turns you into a mutant and people being sent to prison for rejecting it.

I have to take another math/stats/cs course at some point, but I’ve pretty much made my mind up for an upper division stats course since machine learning is apart of that courses curriculum and I’m interested in AI/machine learning (I’m locked out of most upper division cs courses since that’s not my major).

I have to take a course on genomics/computational biology. On top of that, I have another 6 hrs (most classes are 3-4 hours) of additional biology which can come from the fields I mentioned earlier. I also have to take an upper division bio lab course (same fields) and there’s even some field labs available to me.

If not, does the ""body"" recognise the mutated cell as non-self and destroys it or if the cell doesn't meet all the needed criteria, like the needed quantity of material genetic, to go to the next step from the cell cycle, it stops and self distructs?

biology,"Hey everyone! Sorry if this question comes across as simple, but I'm about to embark on a biology degree programme, having previously studied languages at university, and had a question about specialisation and keeping all the school-level and other basic stuff in your head.

So far in my studies I've covered a broad range of basic biology subjects, including everything from cell structures, to the function of organs, to exchange surfaces, human reproduction, plant hormones, evolution, DNA, and much more.

I feel like I'm on top of everything, but sometimes it feels like an insane amount of information to keep in my head, and I wonder if, as I get more specialised down the road if I decide to make a career in biology, I'll need to keep all this basic information in my head, or is it more a case of knowing the basics to have a solid foundation for other stuff?

For example, exchange surfaces, cell structures, and organ function are obviously important in a vast swathe of biology subjects. But let's say I end up becoming a botanist for example, to what extent would I be expected to remember all of the more basic stuff on human reproduction?

I've just pulled a random example out there, and maybe this all sounds naive, but sometimes it can feel overwhelming to think of having to keep all of this in my head. With languages it feels quite different because it's not like the better I get at French, the less I'm going to use basic vocabulary and grammatical structures, because they're used all the time at the advanced level too.

Or is it much the same with biology and other sciences? Perhaps it's all connected in a web I can't see yet, but I have to study quite hard to keep all this varied information in my head, and sometimes I wonder how much of human reproduction I'll be able to remember as a botany specialist (again as a random example).

I hope this post makes some sense, I'd love some input from those who've gone on to study science at postgrad levels and/or become specialists in certain areas. Maybe I need to not worry about this so much at this point and just keep trying to do well at each stage I'm working on. And maybe it's a case that the more studying and practical work I do, the more I'll keep recalling all the information before it becomes second nature?

Thanks so much in advance for any input!

This disrupts the cell's function and eventually the cell dies because its core 'factory' has been messed with and it can no longer build the resources it needs to survive, it can only build virus fragments until it dies.

So if a DNA vaccine causes all of your cells and tissues to produce viral proteins, wouldn't they all die eventually since the cells would not be able to create their own resources needed to survive? This happens in COVID infection, the virus does not cause cells to explode open. It kills cells because it leaves the cell to produce viral proteins until it dies due to not being able to produce stuff it needs to survive. 

Would this happen with the DNA vaccine too?","If DNA vaccines reprogram your cells to start producing viral proteins (just like how a virus does), wouldn't your cells all start to die because they can't produce other proteins during this?"

They start with complaining about a class, but it quickly turns into an extreme oversimplification of the subject and it comes off as if they have no respect for anyone in the field. I guess my question is does anyone have any similar experiences or possibly a positive experience?
I have way too many of my own problems currently to have the energy to argue with them, so Ive just ignored it. Also, the weird part is, the prof is so nice and not like the students at all.

I'm not an anti vaxxer at all. I've had my tetanus, diptheria, pneumonia, HIB, influenza, swine influenza, TB, Meningitis C, B, and W, polio, whooping cough vaccines, Measles Mumps and Rubella vaccine, you name it.

I was so excited to get the COVID 19 vaccine. I was following the vaccine research since late January, sometimes checking in every day to see how much closer we were to getting a vaccine for the virus. 

I noticed a lot of people were against having the vaccine. I just assumed it was anti vaxx nutters as usual.

Then, two days ago, I found out that the COVID 19 vaccine is not like your typical flu shot vaccine, which just introduces a dead virus into your body. 

The vaccine actually alters your DNA - genetic modification. It causes your cells to constantly produce viral proteins - so your immune system will always be fighting an endless war, and we all know a constant immune response is very bad for the body in the long run. When you have a virus, viral proteins are produced by cells, but then the body gets rid of the viruses causing it. So what happens when all of your cells are now producing viral proteins as if they were infected, and the cause is the DNA itself, not a virus you can get rid of without doing much harm?

So, after learning this, I've fallen into a depressive state. I will not allow my DNA to be modified. We do not know the long term effects of a vaccine altering DNA. No other vaccine works this way and traditional vaccines have been proven to be safe and effective.

At this point, I'm thinking of intentionally just exposing myself to COVID, since in my eyes, nobody's producing an actual vaccine for this virus so what is the point anyway. I have a 0.2% chance of dying (more like 0.002% for my age group), or I'll take a highly experimental, never before used type of vaccine that Fauci said will only be 50% effective and will probably have long term effects.

I'm not sure which to trust more. A virus, which is shown to provide T-Cell immunity in 99% of cases after recovery, or a highly experimental vaccine that tampers with your DNA, of which there have been no long term studies to assess the potential effects down the road. Why can't they make a normal vaccine like they do with influenza, polio, tetanus, and literally every other vaccine there is? Why does this new COVID vaccine *have* to meddle with your DNA? It usually takes 5-10 years to make a vaccine but they're rushing out a never before used type of vaccine out in less than a year. Is it that surprising that &gt;50% of people in the UK surveyed have said they do not want to touch this?

Sorry if I sound over dramatic but this has left me kind of heartbroken. It's like having a severe chronic illness and you really want that chronic illness to be cured. Scientists promise a cure, they say they will find a special pill to cure you. But then 6 months later they reveal that the cure is a pill that contains radiation and they hope the radiation alters your DNA enough that your chronic illness goes away, rather than a normal pill.

According to what I read, the vaccine ***hacks your DNA, and makes your cells produce foreign proteins for the rest of your life to provoke an immune response.*** This makes the immune system think it's being attacked constantly. My question is - how is that healthy in the long run? Is that not what an auto immune disease is, when the immune system believes it is constantly under attack? With a virus, your immune system simply kills the viruses producing the foreign proteins, but if all your cells are producing foreign proteins due to their DNA being changed, what happens then? T cells for instance destroy tissues that have foreign proteins in them, it's how  a lot of (eventually fatal) auto immune diseases work. COVID itself often doesn't kill you, it's the overly strong or too long-lasting immune response that kills most patients.",I was super excited to get the COVID 19 vaccine.

This is my first time posting on reddit so I’m sorry if anything is a little messed up. Anyways, I was wondering if it would be possible to do a biological science degree and find a way to get into a position where I am working in an area like wildlife conservation or something similar with animals (non-medical when relating to animals). I’m all for research and lab work, but anything super medical related I’m not 100% with. I’m currently looking into doing a biological science program within the next year or so. But want to make sure I’m on the right track. I’m aware a biological science degree can be diverse. But I was wondering if is a possibility. I’m currently doing a course that’ll get me in for some lab work. But I’m interested working in the wildlife kind of area and (seems to be a little off from wildlife, haha) research. I would be interested in research like vaccine development or something similar to being in the lab and testing for things like this.  I’m just scared I’ll go in for the biological science degree and find out I took the wrong path (if that makes sense). 

I hope this is the right subreddit to ask (I believe there is one on zoology but I’m interested in the possibility of the wildlife field; not specifically zoology). If not, sorry in advance. Again, this is my first time posting anything so I might be in the wrong place. Thanks for all the help!

biology,"Hi everyone,

Ever since quarantine began, I’ve been stock trading to make some extra cash on the side, and recently, I’ve gotten pretty heavy into it. Now you might be wondering what that has to do with this sub, so let me tell you just that. 

I invested in a biotech company called IBIO, which has been working along with other companies to aid the world in this Covid race. That being said, their manufacturing process is really interesting and I think it’ll be quite valuable for vaccine creation. Their stock was at $2.00 per share back a few months ago and then it jumped all the way to $7.5 in late July before tanking recently all the way below $2.00. The price first dropped to around $3.00 after the announcement of the Russian vaccine came about, but then it tanked further due to a bearish market that was caused by an insider selling by a shareholder named Dart. The rumors being passed around are that Dart did it for one of two reasons:

1. IBIO can’t receive government funding if they have more than a certain percentage (25% I think) of foreign ownership, and Dart is a foreign owner who had more ownership than that percentage.

2. Dart’s other businesses aren’t performing as well due to the Covid situation, and he potentially wanted to put his funds there to help them recover.

That being said, no other insider selling has occurred since then despite how much the price tanked. So that tells me that these insiders still believe in the upside of the stock and that the downtrend is based on panic selling pretty much.

I’m here because you all have some biological education background and I was wondering what you all think of the work IBIO is doing. I’ve done my own fair of research on the company, but I don’t know much from a biological perspective and would like to hear your opinions in that regard. Is what they’re doing revolutionary? Are there any potential drawbacks to their processes and style of making vaccines? Are the non-Covid vaccines they’re producing of high value, demand, and significance? How feasible are their goals?

If you can please help with this, I would really appreciate it because I thought I was lucky to buy the stock’s first dip post Russian vaccine news, but it tanked further on me, and now I’m kinda stuck bag holding, so I’m somewhat trying to decide if I should hold long term or sell off the shares I have (if there’s no potential in the company’s growth).

biology,"Ok, to start off, I mean no offense to anyone with this question, because I get that it can be a little bit controversial in its nature. But I'm so curious about this and I've wondered for a long time. 

To explain what I mean by the question:   
I am not referring to ALL women and ALL men. Everyone looks different. Some men can look quite soft and naturally less masculine, and some women can have more masculine features, and everyone can be beautiful/handsome in their own way, but I'm talking about most cases of a typical male/female appearance. 

Ok so, I was watching this movie, and it had a woman hiding the fact she was a woman. And it got me thinking. Most women, considering they have no work done (plastic surgery), no makeup, and possibly covering their hair or wearing it short or in a typically masculine style, and covering their body shape (perhaps many layers of clothes) can pretty much look like a soft-featured 'pretty' guy. 

But, most men, even with shaved facial hair, and wearing long hair in a feminine style, feminine clothes, and even with fake breasts, are still obviously men, or at least they don't appear like a woman as convincingly as a woman could appear as a man (in the way I mentioned first). Makeup could adjust the illusion (think of drag queens that appear as convincing women, using contouring etc) but I'd say these count as exceptions.

I was wondering why that was. I imagine the answer is a combination of biological, psychological, and maybe even social/cultural. And again, I mean no disrespect to anybody, whether they are transgender or androgynous or non-binary, or anybody. I'm simply curious about this phenomenon about most men and women, and I'm also wondering if anyone else has experienced this. But please tell me if you think I'm talking bullshit. 

Please let this be a respectful discussion. Thank you","Why can women look like soft-featured men, but men can less commonly look like women?"

biology,"For most of human history, men have dominated. Only in the past 50 years have women really become equal with men in some aspects although this is mostly concentrated in the west and highly modernized countries. Still, Men and women are more similar than they are different whether its genetically, socially, or psychologically regardless small differences do exist. I came across this TedTalk on Youtube about how same-sex reproduction via stem cells may be one day possible here is the link: [https://youtu.be/k75DToh-ArU](https://youtu.be/k75DToh-ArU). In general, men can conceive both girls and boys since they have XY chromosomes while women can only conceive girls since they have XX chromosomes. If such a technology were to develop in the future it would be revolutionary and destructive in sense to what is considered ""traditional"" but would be interesting nonetheless. Another interesting thing is the fact that both males and females develop as girls first in the womb until 5-6 weeks which is when the SRY gene on the Y chromosome activates and starts the process of male development in fetuses. Here is a quick video on that:[https://youtu.be/z1Kdoja3hlk](https://youtu.be/z1Kdoja3hlk). This made me feel very weird since I am a male but it reminded me that I'm not much different from a woman. Anyways back to the main point of this post which is regarding the impact of the Y chromosome. This really shocked me since the Y chromosomes are very tiny compared to the X chromosome which technically means that men get **slightly more** genes from their mom then they do from their dad's! Either way, the fact that the Y chromosome differentiates men and women despite having only a fraction of genes as the X chromosome is mind-boggling; there are about 200 genes on the Y chromosome while the X chromosome has 900-1,400 genes. This is just awe-inducing to learn that the reason why men are on **average** taller, stronger, faster, etc. also not to mention that hormones do come a long way but the biggest impact is in our genetics. Truly men and women have everything in common except the Y chromosome! Unfortunately, the Y chromosome is also degenerating since unlike the other chromosomes it doesn't recombine. However, that won't be the end of men since humans still reproduce sexually so the SRY gene might migrates to the X chromosome or maybe the Y chromosome will get replaced? Also from what has been observed the Y chromosome is also trying to slow down its degeneration which I read about from several studies; either way men aren't going just vanish into thin air in the future. In the end, we should remember that neither sex is better than the other, but hopefully you found this to be a very humbling experience to learn more about the impact of the Y chromosome.",The insane impact of the Y chromosome

biology,"\#David\_Latimar This bottle was planted inside the bottle in 1980 and has never been opened for the last 48 years. As a result, an ecosystem has developed inside this bottle over a long period of time. Which has been defending itself for a long time. This bottle does not exchange anything from the outside. The plant produces oxygen and receives nutrients from the humus in the soil.

The fallen leaves and other parts of the tree fall to the ground and are re-formed into simple matter by bacteria, which breaks down the organic matter and releases carbon dioxide into the air. The steam generated during the percolation process condenses and accumulates in the soil and is reabsorbed by the roots. The result is a water cycle.

Since all the essential elements of the tree are recycled from the tree and the soil, there is no need to supply anything from outside. However, the bottle plant was not sealed at the very beginning.

Four seeds of Spider Wort were planted in 1980 in a 10 gallon bottle with soil and compost. One of these trees survives. It is sealed and placed in a place full of sunlight. After 12 years, the bottle was opened and sealed permanently with water in 1982.

For the past 48 years it has been completely isolated from the outside world, and for the past 26 years it has been in the same place as Latimer's home. This is a remarkable example of the life cycle on earth.#coppied

[**Where is That Noise Coming From!?!**](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkaa668/5893975) **(Open Access)**

Gene expression in cells is “noise-y”. Protein levels vary from one cell to the next, even if those cells are genetically identical and are grown in the same environment. To find the source of this “noise”, the [Bleris lab](https://personal.utdallas.edu/~bleris/) has teased apart “gene expression at the transcriptional, translational, and post-translational level using custom engineered circuits stably integrated in human cells using CRISPR”. The study, published in *Nucleic Acids Research*, shows that most noise comes from transcription.

[**Stable Genetic Circuits in** ](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20209584)[***E. coli***](https://www.embopress.org/doi/full/10.15252/msb.20209584) **(Open Access)**

The [Voigt lab](http://web.mit.edu/voigtlab/) is back, with a new study in *Molecular Systems Biology*. They “designed genomic landing pads in *E. coli* at high-expression sites” that are stable for weeks, without selection. Their integrated circuits also required fourfold less RNA polymerase compared to those same circuits on plasmids.

[**Diagnosing Ebola and Lassa cases in real-time**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17994-9) **(Open Access)**

Viral hemorrhagic fevers demand rapid diagnostics, and CRISPR-based systems are quickly emerging as the victor. A new study, with dozens of contributing labs, shows that Cas13a ([SHERLOCK](https://www.broadinstitute.org/developing-diagnostics-and-treatments/sherlock), specifically) can diagnose Ebola and Lassa viruses with 100% sensitivity. The team even developed a mobile application to quickly report results, and deployed the tech in Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The work was published in *Nature Communications*.

[**Cas13a Detects Small Molecules** ](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkaa673/5892748)**(Open Access)**

Cas13a is more versatile than you think. In a separate study, Cas13a was modified to quantify the concentration of up to eight samples in a single reaction. [The team](https://www.colorado.edu/lab/bateygroup/), from the University of Colorado at Boulder, thinks that “hundreds of reactions can be easily quantified in a few hours”. The work is out now in *Nucleic Acids Research*.

[**Pow Pow! Knocking Out Herpes Virus in Mice**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17936-5.pdf) **(Open Access)**

The [Jerome lab](https://research.fhcrc.org/jerome/en.html) at the University of Washington has used [meganucleases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meganuclease) — a type of restriction enzyme — to eliminate over 90% of latent herpes simplex virus in mice. They delivered the gene-editing proteins via adeno-associated viruses (AAVs), and found that a “triple AAV serotype combination” works best. The study was published in *Nature Communications*; check out the [press release!](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200818094019.htm)

biology,"So this is a bit of an odd question, I realize, but I thought maybe people have some interesting ideas or precedents...

As so many people, I've gotten into sourdough baking during quarantine, and to do this, you use something called a ""sourdough starter"", which is a stable colony of _Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis_ (which produces lactic and acetic acid which give the bread a sour tang) and a yeast like _Candida humilis_ which produces alcohol (which, after baking, gives the bread a nutty taste) and CO2, which leavens the bread (turning it from a hard, teeth-shattering brick of flour into a delighful sponge of gluten and starch).

The general (if perhaps not very scientific) consensus seems to be that the more often you feed your starter, the more ""active"" it becomes, i.e. the more CO2 it produces in a given span of time, which is important. 

So I was thinking: To keep my starter in peak condition, I'd ideally like to feed it very frequently, say, every hour. Starter is fed with a slurry of water and flour.

So I was imagining some sort of contraption that looks like a chem lab column, where slurry is discarded at the bottom at a constant rate, and new slurry is added at a constant rate at the top. To extract starter for baking, you would open the column in the middle somehow, and extract some of the starter that is going through it's peak growing phase.

But there's a couple practical problems. For instance if the slurry that drops in from the top is pre-mixed, it could get infected by the microbes and start fermenting itself. On the other hand mixing the slurry in-situ seems a bit difficult. The discard valve at the bottom would also be liable to clog up if the slurry is not very well mixed.

Are there any precedents for this kind of thing? I assume when this stuff is done professionally, labs usually use some sort of constant heat oven and just manually switch out the nutrient plates or similar?",Constructing an infinitely growing column of microbes?

My current pre-major advisor isn't the best of help either. One option is to pursue a career in the biology research field. I've had two internships with the DOD so far (working with nerve agent countermeasures), and I would love to have a more permanent position there after a graduate. However, I'm not sure if I'm cut-out for this type of career. Typical imposter's syndrome. I'm not the best at chemistry and sometimes I feel like my classmates know so much more than me... it's a slight downfall.

This mixing or blending of my majors would be the IDEAL solution, but I'm not sure what careers that would be. (My friends always joke that I should film the next 'Blue Planet' documentary.)

biology," 

Hello, I am studying something about enteropathogenic *E. coli* but first I need to understand how it causes (anti) inflammation.

After reading few papers, I understand that EPEC attenuates inflammation by delivering effector proteins through its Type 3 secretory system (T3SS) into the host cell. These effector proteins then mediate anti-inflammation by preventing phosphorylation of key kinases which ultimately lead to decreased NfKb-activated inflammation.

Now, my confusion lies in whether it does cause net inflammation in the system, or does it not?

1. Don't all infection cause inflammation? Yes, initial EPEC infection might cause inflammation but its effector system lowers this inflammation as an immuno-evasive strategy, right?
2. However, EPEC causes membrane disruption in gut cells which ultimately lead to diarrhea due to ionic imbalance caused by a leaky membrane. Doesn't this by itself cause inflammation?

So I guess, I need validation in my thinking that all these things still cause a NET increase in inflammation versus the uninfected state of host cells, right? (Despite some kind of anti-inflammatory mechanism carried by EPEC)

Forgive me if this is a stupid question, I am learning. Hope you can guide me towards the correct direction and maybe recommend some papers on inflammation and host-pathogen interactions. :)",Inflammation from infection but pathogen causes anti-inflammation?

biology,,"Do our bones get compressed aka shorter as we age, over the span of 20 years or so?"
biology,"       On avg the woman lives longer than the man. The long pregnancy and vulnerability of a woman and child cause the man to have a shorter life span, in a reproductive evolutionary take.

       Wouldn’t it make more sense for men to outlive their women counterparts?. The man can fertilize and procreate many at a time, without the dreaded MENopause affecting their capability. So to continue procreating, as much as possible, it is more beneficial for men to live as long as possible - allowing them to spread their seed as much as possible! Especially since an old man can procreate almost as long as they live, while women become capable in their pre-teens til their 40’s (that’s only about 30 years!) Women also must carry a fetus to 9 months (high risk), nurse and care for the baby; thus fractioning the probability of many successful reproductions. The child also gains much independence around the age of 14 (needing the mother’s care up til then, occupying the women, and limiting their number of reproduction). Once the woman can no longer reproduce or care for a child (like in most animal kingdoms), they are less protected and weaker (age) - leading them to be more prone to early death. Whereas, the man would be surrounded by women and children - less likely to die early.
       
         The must-have protection from the male species - that the female species and child need through pregnancy, birth, and years of care - changes the male species’ behavior. The protective behavior will thus cut their lifespan. Therefore, the hunter-gatherer evolutionary step switched the circumstances. 
Male and female species work one-to-one in order to reproduce more successfully. Rather than the males reproducing at high numbers  but with less successful reproduction (more children likely to die due to lack of support and protection). 

         Their is so much more to this than I can type, and so many other tangents/exceptions, so don’t come for me! Lol! 

Remember evolution is happening as we speak! 

Long hypothesis short: men should live longer bc they can reproduce more, but they don’t bc they help protect their children and put themselves in more harm’s way. QUALITY OVER QUANTITY!",Men Die Younger Than Women Hypothesis
biology,"Cancer can be thought of as a disease caused by an inevitable increase in entropy. If our cells are seen as ordered esicles of information, matter, and energy, inevitable disturbances in any one of these systems due to environmental factors or errors in regulation can increase disorder within the cell. The accumulation of these disturbances (i.e. mutations, mitochondrial toxicity, microenvironmental changes) increase disorder within the tissue and create malignancies that form cancer. 

The only way to curb the 2nd law of thermodynamics is to input energy into a system. Entropy can be maintained or reduced by inputing energy into a system. Cancer is a disease caused by an increase in entropy. So a cure to cancer would require using a therapeutic that consumes energy. Small molecules and static biologics do not consume energy. However, living therapeutics like CAR-T cells or gene-circuit based biotherapeutics like the ones being developed by Senti Biosciences do require energy and thus, from a physics standpoint, would seem viable as potential cures to cancer.

biology,"I may be a few days late but happy belated birthday to Frederick Sanger (b. August 12th 1918). He was British biochemist known to have won the Nobel prize in Chemistry twice, in 1958 and then in 1980, both a recognition for his work on sequences. For his first Nobel prize, Sanger devised a series of brilliant molecular, chromatographic, and ionophoretic methods in order to determine the precise order of amino acids in the polypeptide hormone insulin showing that it consisted of two disulphide-bonded chains of 21 and 30 amino acids respectively, at a time when very few protein chemistry techniques were known. In a work that spanned ten years, he developed the fluorodinitrobenzene (FDNB) reagent, also known as Sanger's reagent, to react selectively with the N-terminal amino group at one end of the polypeptide chain. Sanger then partially hydrolyzed (broke down via enzyme or HCl) the resulting DNP-protein (Dinitrophenyl protein) into amino acid segments and this yielded free amino acids along with the amino acid labelled with the DNP tag. The technique then involved extracting the acid-stable yellow coloured DNP derivatives with amino groups via paper chromatography. Using proteases to break the peptides into many smaller overlapping fragments, Sanger worked backwards and repeated the steps in order to deduce the entire sequence of insulin. His techniques showed that insulin contains two chains with different end groups. The chains were determined through the use of chromatography. 

Although now obsolete, Sanger's methods were a breakthrough in biochemistry. They laid the foundations behind the construction of the human insulin gene and subsequent use of genetically modified bacteria as a ""factory"" for the production of insulin in the 1970s. Insulin at this point, had only been derived from animals such as cows and pigs and thus presented potential antigenic activity. Sanger's discoveries were also very crucial in that they spurred further identification of many proteins in the ensuing decades. In fact, since Sanger, several thousands of human proteins have been sequenced. 

For his second Nobel prize in 1980, Sanger developed the dideoxy chain sequencing for determining the exact sequence of bases in DNA. Calling it ""the best idea he ever had"", Sanger's chain termination method allowed stretches of 500-800 bases to be read at a time. In this ingenious idea, the region of DNA to be sequenced is denatured in order to produce single-stranded DNA that can act as a template for the synthesis of a new DNA strand. A primer is annealed to the 5' end of the template strand. Radiolabelled dNTPS needed for DNA polymerase to copy DNA and, short for deoxynucleoside triphosphates, are then added to the primer strand along with DNA polymerase which of course is to insert the complementary nucleotides into the nascent DNA strand. Four reactions are set up, each with one ddNTPs (short dideoxynucleoside triphosphate which differ from normal dNTPS in that they lack the 3 ́-hydroxyl group where one nucleotide attached to another to form a chain and terminate chain elongation at a specific base depending on which one of four ddNTPs is used; they effectively prevent the formation of a phosphodiester bond). Nucleotide chains of varying lengths are produced as a result. After electrophoresis of all samples, the band pattern is read to determine the complementary DNA sequence. 

Sanger's work with DNA was instrumental to the Human Genome Project, which helped unlock the genetic code of human life and has remained the basis behind the automated DNA sequencing technologies of today ever since. 

Sanger was indeed one of the most influential biologists of the 20th century and a maker of modern genetics.

Does anyone have any suggestions on good college text books for intro/general biology? Ignoring cost, atm, I’m trying to get back into school in the next year or so and I want to get my BS, and almost every school I’m applying to has general bio as a two semester class.

I need to try and get some of this stuff down! Suggestions please ☺️",intro/general bio book + syllabus

[**Listening to the Music of a Cell**](https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/artl_a_00325?journalCode=artl)

[Eduardo Reck Miranda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eduardo_Reck_Miranda) is a professor of computer music at the University of Plymouth. In his latest paper, he introduces “a system for music composition informed by synthetic biology”, in which music is generated via simulations of various cellular processes, including transcription and protein folding. The study was published in *Artificial Life*.

At UCLA, the [Liao lab](http://www.seas.ucla.edu/liao_lab/) has engineered *E. coli* to utilize methanol as its sole carbon source. With a paltry doubling time of 8.5 hours, the team began by using “metabolic robustness criteria” to engineer the strain, followed by laboratory evolution, and found that the final organism carefully balanced metabolic flux by tuning gene copy numbers and mutating key enzymes. The work was published in *Cell*.

[**Going Deeeep on the SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain**](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)31003-5) **(Open Access)**

[Researchers](https://research.fhcrc.org/bloom/en.html) at the University of Washington and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, in Seattle, have performed a deep-mutational scan on the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD), the bit that binds to ACE2 on human cells. They created every single amino-acid substitution in the RBD, and show that, while most mutations are deleterious, some mutations enhance affinity for ACE2. The work was published in *Cell*.

The engineered plants also had an increase in above-ground biomass of up to 52% compared to controls. The study was published in *Nature Plants*.

The [Xiao lab](https://xiao.rice.edu/) at Rice University has engineered *E. coli* to both synthesize a 21st amino acid (5-hydroxyl-tryptophan, or 5HTP) and then site-specifically incorporate it into proteins. The team then used the engineered cell to “serve as a living indicator for reactive oxygen species”, as stated by Xiao in a Rice [press release](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/08/200812161331.htm).

My question is: Has this neural network ever been simulated and if not, why not? What I mean is this:

When a neuron is stimulated by contact for example, it creates an impulse which will travel along the neural circuitry of the C. elegans quite predictably since the entire network is known. This can be simulated to create a ""simulation worm"". A computer program can simulate the generation of such an impulse and visualize how it would travel along the nervous system. In turn, this impulse will trigger other neurons which control muscles (also fully mapped) and this can result in movement for example. Thus one can create a virtual specimen which would simulate the behavior of a real worm based on certain stimuli (of course not perfectly, and assuming that worms don't have free will).

biology,"Hi! First of all I know no biology whatsoever and I'm not an English native speaker so I apologize in advance if something doesn't make sense.

From what I understand, when a species changes, evolves or whatever you want to call it, it is because that change at the time was an advantage over the rest of its species, this is, for example, the typical example of giraffes (giraffes with shorter necks do not reach the food in the trees while longer necked ones do, which causes those with shorter necks to die because they cannot eat while those with long necks live...) if that makes sense.

So, I hear people saying a lot that over time, we will lose or pinky toes because we don't use them anymore, How does this make sense? Why would the species lose a toe if having it or not having it doesn't suppose an advantage over the rest of humans? And also this would mean that to lose this toe first we would  have to have people naturally born without it and those ones to at some point outnumber us who have it. I have also heard people saying that because of how much we use our phones, babies are born now with longer thumbs. This type of reasoning I believe is called Lamarckism and was proved wrong a long time ago, Am I wrong?

There must be something I'm missing, since by this reasoning there's a lot of things in human bodies that we could still have since having them or not doesn't really suppose a big advantage over the rest of the species, for instance, having hair all over our bodies.

biology,"(\*) by ""why"" I mean: are there logical reasons for this, or is this ""just the way it is""? For example, would there be obvious evolutionary advantages, or biochemical or physiological constraints that would force this to be the case?

I realize my question is probably not too clear. One example of what I mean is the renin-angiotensin-aldoesterone system. From what I understand, the initial ""start"" of the pathway begins with the kidneys. Then, after all the steps, the effect also takes place at the kidneys. So then, why couldn't the pathway be much shorter with all the needed molecules being localized in the kidneys?

Another example that comes to my mind is with signal transduction, but at least with that I get that more steps = more chances for amplification and/or regulation. 

So then in general, does involving multiple steps and proteins give the organism a ""finer"" ability to regulate the pathway(s)? Are there other reasons?","Why(*) do many biological pathways that ""begin"" and ""end"" at the same tissue tend to have so many steps, sometimes involving distant tissues, rather than being localized to the same place?"

biology,"I read a book called Other Minds, its broadly about Octopi/Cuttlefish behaviour and neurology on the premise that they're intelligent yet completely alien to us.

Now why would an Octopus with a lifespan of only 4 years develop the capacity to learn so much about its environment, have excellent memory and problem solving skills?.. 

He reasons that octopi must survive to maturity and breed to propagate the species however anything after that first reproduction is simply excess. Since they're quite vulnerable their biology is geared towards an 'all or nothing' breeding event as there is no guarantee any individual survives another year to reproduce again. The species he studies took 4 years to achieve maturity, it breeds, it dies.

This mutation would be selected due to individuals having a clear advantage in passing on that gene.

For example, we had a lovely time last night having had sex, I had not orgasmed,  but I was sated and very happy and we were just cuddling in the afterglow.

About three to four minutes after we were just laying and having a nice cuddle, I have these really strong ‘waves’ which make my back arch, and my entire body feel super tingly, it’s feels a lot like a prostate orgasm, as this happens a lot more after anal sex for me. But I wasn’t being sexually stimulated at all, and wasn’t even erect.

I don’t ejaculate during this, but the feelings are utterly incredible. I have normally two or three of those in quick succession, and they are lip bitingly luscious, and I am in raptures.

Afterward my entire skin feels like it’s on red alert, and I super super sensitive to touch.

When my gf and I got together this would happen quite often after she’d pegged me, one time I actually blacked out for 5-10 seconds, she had to check I was still breathing, but that’s much less common now! (Mainly because I have a handle on it!)

I’d love to hear of anyone thought on what’s happening, biologically speaking, or if anyone else has this or not, it would be nice to know I’m not alone! Some of my partners are a bit freaked out as they’ve never seen it before.

biology,"

Im 19 , pretty big build , got alot of muscle mass but over lockdown i gained a few pounds and got a little belly fat and i want to nip it in the bud before it gets out of control and going from 2000-3500 calories a day which i was able to consume no problem as i have a relatively high metabolism because i did alot of exercise , to 200 calories is absolutely crazy i never actually knew it would have been this hard to not eat at all and just drink water to keep me feeling full.

The desire to eat is literally nearly uncontrollable but my mindset is strong, I honestly used to think not eating at all for a day would be extremely easy but its not , its actually extremely hard because sugar is extremely addictive and everything contrains sugars in some way or another these days .

Its been 26hrs since i last ate , if i dont take the 200 calories from 1 banana at breakfast and 1 banana at lunch into consideration.

I did walk 7 miles yesterday and went swimming in the ocean for abit which probably burned 800 calories at best but dealing with a hangover and the big mood drop and noticeably increased anxiety and mood instability from not eating is definitely extremely challenging, i feel on the verge of crying at this point in the literal sense meaning sometimes i feel like i just wanna cry for no explainable reason or coming close to it .

I get that my dopamine levels are probably extremely low from no sugar intake except for the small amount of natural sugars found in the banana i ate but what biologically is causing me to feel this way? , i dont know if this is the right sub for this question.

Honestly fasting like this is extremely difficult more than i could have imagined, im well hydrated as ive drank 13 cups of water today.

I might just fast for 36hrs","Yesterday i drank 9 pints and ate a shwarma but my will power remains strong , today i have only eaten 2 small bananas, (212) calories"
biology,"This text might get big, so I'll leave a tldr at the end. Also sorry if I say something or names wrong, english isn't my first language. Anyways...

I'm asking this because I'm getting very unsatisfied with my actual course at College (gastronomy). When I chose to study this I was very excited, but over time I started to notice that this area isn't really for me and the spark of joy I used to have when learning it has gradually faded.
 Meanwhile I've had an increased interest for biology for quite a while now. I've started gardening in vases for like 2 years now and I just loved staying close to plants, seeing them growing, flowers blooming, fruits appearing, and a bunch of insects forming an ecosystem seemingly out of nowhere. I was so fascinated with how much I was experiencing and learning out of just seeing seeds growing it was almost therapeutic. The last few days I started ""planting"" some shimeji mushrooms and I can't put into words how thrilled I feel every day I go and water the mushrooms and see how life can still grow in a dark, humid place.
I also really enjoy learning about animal and insect behaviour (mostly insects thanks to my boyfriend who loves moths, lately making me have a stupidly big interest for spiders and bees), and also other micro... Creatures overall. I love being on places involved in nature and just look at animals and plants being themselves, seeing how they eat, how they behave to each other etc.

For the past couple months I've been thinking about the idea of studying biology and work in the area (I think it's called a major or something to work at labs and researches), mostly because of my huge interest in nature, and the idea of working with researches and studies, things that I never thought before, just fills me with excitement and the Joy I once had before. 
I'm overall a very, very, VERY chill, calm, and overall an introveted guy, so I guess that contrasts a lot with the work environment of a restaurant, wich is why I've been feeling like it's not for me anymore (I've been working at a restaurant for a year now). 
Anyways, I would like to ask to the fellow biologists and students of the area if you guys think it's worth giving it a go. Do you enjoy what you do? What area should I focus? I would love to know your opinion. I don't know anyone who went to study biology to give me any advices, and since I'm trying to decide what to do I believe the opinion of those who work in the area are extremely important! 

Welp, I guess that's about it. Thanks you so much if you've read until here!

I'm 26F, graduated from a tough school with a BA in Bio and Psych. I chose that originally with the goal of med school, but I developed major mental health issues halfway through college and tanked my GPA. At that point, I was so lost on a direction and my family/advisors completely abandoned me, so I graduated with no plan, no meaningful experience, and a GPA that would make grad school quite difficult to get into (3.3). 

I took the first job I could get out of college, harvesting corneas and eyes from organ/tissue donors. I moved up in this field a bit, and now I'm still here, mostly reviewing donors' medical charts and cutting corneal tissue in a lab for transplants. I've mainly stayed here for the same reason I stuck with the bio degree... not sure what else to do. Problem is, it's kind of a dead end field with little opportunity for advancement. Most people in this field go get a second degree in nursing - and I took prereqs for this, but I'm starting to think I would hate being a nurse.

I've considered a few options: 
1) Starting from the ground up, working as a lab tech to gain experience and maybe, if I can ever get in, going for a PhD. 
2) Trying to get a job as a clinical research coordinator (has proven very difficult, very competitive. Only got 1 interview)
3) Would enjoy something regulatory-based given my familiarity with FDA regulations, but not sure where to start with that.
4) Pharma sales - part of my current job involves going to the OR and showing surgeons how to use medical devices, so I wondered if I could use this to get my foot in the door in pharma.
5) saying fuck it, doing something completely unrelated to my degree.

biology,"Hello all! I hope you all are having a great day filled with biology of some sort.

Lately I have been thinking a lot about where I want to steer my career.

I graduated from a cellular biology program at the top university in my home state about 2 years ago. Honestly in college my biology experience was very spread out between all the categories within biology. I got a good taste of multiple categories of biology(ecology/evo, Micro, Cell imaging, Sequencing, and a lot of field work on arthropods, etc). To be honest I found everything biology interesting to the point where I have a hard time imagining what I would like to dedicate further edu and a career towards.

Right out of college I worked as a vaccine manufacturing tech using chicken embryos. The pay was good but the job wasn't for me lol... After that I started working in a medical diagnostics lab focusing on microbiology. I have been working in this lab for about 8 months now and it has been a great experience! I have had the opportunity to learn all sorts of useful microbiology techniques and procedures with my favorite being yeast identification from patients. I really have loved this job in all honesty however I would like to make more money at some point. The pay is low mostly due to where I live according to my research I think.

I plan on going back to school at some point in the next 3 years but I just don't know what kind of program I would want to do yet... And obviously I don't want to jump the gun and choose something that I wish I hadn't later.

Out of all things considered I have been interested in the areas of Micro/Cell/Molecular/Agriculture/Ecology and recently I have started looking into areas like Bioinformatics and Biotech! These last two seem to have the potential to have high pay but I'm not sure if I would want to get out of the wet lab setting...

Anyways! What resources did you use to choose your career path?

### This week in research…

[**Controlling Engineered T-cells with Ultrasound**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00238)

In the latest work from the [Shapiro lab](http://shapirolab.caltech.edu/) at Caltech, published in *ACS Synthetic Biology*, T-cells with engineered heat shock promoters were controlled “[with brief pulses of heat delivered by focused ultrasound](http://shapirolab.caltech.edu/),” inducing them to release cytokines and target tumor cells.

[**Automated Genetic Circuit Design for Yeast**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0757-2)

At MIT, the [Voigt lab](http://web.mit.edu/voigtlab/) has constructed nine NOT/NOR gates, with a 400-fold dynamic range, in *S. cerevisiae*. With these gates in hand, they then used Cello 2.0, a software to design genetic circuits, to “build circuits with up to 11 regulatory proteins.” The study could dramatically simplify circuit design for eukaryotic synthetic biology, and was published in *Nature Microbiology*.

[**Automated Cell Culture System with DIY Hardware**](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.3000794) **(Open Access)**

With some printed circuit boards and off-the-shelf components, costing about $300, a [team at Oxford](http://sysos.eng.ox.ac.uk/wiki/index.php/User:Antonis) has created a cell culture automation system with several useful features; the device can measure and record cell growth, and the seven-color LEDs can be used to measure multiple fluorescent proteins in parallel, or for optogenetics. The system, called Chi.Bio, was published in *PLoS Biology*.

For more on this study, [check out my interview](https://medium.com/bioeconomy-xyz/automated-biology-is-now-an-affordable-reality-753684775521) with the lead author, Dr. Harrison Steel.

[**Phase Separation in Human Cells with “Designer” Disordered Proteins**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41557-020-0511-7)

The [Chilkoti lab](https://bme.duke.edu/faculty/ashutosh-chilkoti) at Duke University has designed a set of artificial, intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that can be used to engineer intracellular condensates in living cells. In a new study, published in *Nature Chemistry*, they show that the behavior of the engineered condensates are predictable, and can be tuned by controlling the mass and structure of the IDPs. Chilkoti said in a [Duke press release](https://pratt.duke.edu/about/news/idp-organelles) that this study “provides very simple engineering principles to program this behavior \[intracellular condensates\] within a cell.”

[**Chemicals Stymie CRISPR Gene Drives**](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acssynbio.0c00117)

At [Yonsei University](https://www.yonsei.ac.kr/en_sc/index.jsp), in Seoul, South Korea, the [Kim lab](https://sites.google.com/site/hyongbumkimlab/professor) has developed a chemical method to control CRISPR-based gene drives in *Drosophila* fruit flies. Using a site-specific recombinase induced by a chemical, called RU486, they demonstrate a gene drive removal rate of 7-12% in each generation. The work was published in *ACS Synthetic Biology*.

I’m wondering if there are any types of viruses, fungi, bacteria, etc. that the immune system cannot categorize? 

As in, if virus-Z infects a person, the immune system will know it’s sick, but will react as if the virus is bacteria.

Was reading this article in the Atlantic, and this part stood out to me.

Intentionally made the phrasing of this posts title confusing. 


“There’s a further twist. Normally, the immune system mobilizes different groups of cells and molecules when fighting three broad groups of pathogens: viruses and microbes that invade cells, bacteria and fungi that stay outside cells, and parasitic worms. Only the first of these programs should activate during a viral infection. But Iwasaki’s team recently showed that all three activate in severe COVID-19 cases. “It seems completely random,” she says. In the worst cases, “the immune system almost seems confused as to what it’s supposed to be making.’”

biology,"I would like to preface this with the fact that I am not a biologist, and I'm sure by comparison to most of you I don't know a whole lot. I am a writer, I am working on a short story, and I was some of you could help me with what I'm writing about. If you don't care at all what the story is which my questions relate to, skip the next paragraph. 

THE STORY:  
I won't go into detail and try to keep this as simple as possible: a science fiction story, it takes place in the future, in this future fast food &amp; delivery have taken over to the point where they are the only accessible source of food for the average person. The few companies that run the industry have used genetic manipulation to create crossbred animals (for efficient farming and to breed animals to who's meat taste specific ways for specific dishes). Some of these animals, due to the characteristics they were given, seem to live unpleasant lives. Others seemed quite happy. The story is mostly about the moral implications of creating creatures that live unpleasant lives for the purposes of food and whether that is necessarily worse than creatures living unpleasant lives in a more natural environment/agricultural system. 

THE BIOLOGY QUESTIONS: What I want from the biology people is as much info as possible into what goes into why different animals taste different or may or may not be more efficient to farm? 

Some info I've gathered: (correct me on any of this if I'm wrong)

\-Myoglobin is an important oxygen carrying protein in muscle and it imparts rich/gamey flavours. There is much more of it in red meat than poultry. The parts of poultry with higher myoglobin are the ""dark meat"" portions 

\- many volatile compounds responsible for different flavours are fat soluble - those flavours will be unnoticed if the food cools down and the fat hardens

\- slaughering meat can affect it's flavour, adrenaline and hormones (from fear, etc.) can affect the flavour of meat 

\- when swimming, fish work most of their muscles fairly evenly, so the meat tends to have a pretty consistent flavour and texture throughout a given fish

biology,"Hello science people!

I'm a recent grad with a biology degree and I've been applying to jobs like crazy. There is this one job that I've been lucky enough to get to the last round, which is the third interview that's like an hour and thirty mins long with the higher ups and other molecular supervisors (I'm assuming). I've never been this far in an interview and is very nervous for this. I was wondering what kind of technical and behavioral questions they might ask. So this position that I applied for is called the extraction technologist and from the job description there will be molecular techniques like DNA/RNA extraction, PCR, and gel electrophoresis. I have experience with all these techniques and know how it works. I believe this position is mainly to do with COVID-19 testing or oncological testing. 

I really appreciate the suggestions and advice!

My question/concern is it was out in the rain, on a cement patio making large circles (1.5’-2’) but also moving in a direction while doing it.
It would stop and scratch and itch itself (using back legs up on back and chewing at front legs) fairly often. It honestly looked like he was taking a bath.

It definitely a strong possibility it could of gotten hurt by the outdoor cat but it didn’t appear obviously injured- he had a little bit of a “sashay” to its walk but was using all four limbs. But if he was injured wouldn’t he had been hiding not out on a cement patio at 11am?

biology,"Hi, just a question. Everyone is under the assumption that invasive species are inherently bad. And I have no doubt that in some cases, they are and can cause a lot of damage. But I feel like a lot of people don't have an accurate view of what they are. 

Invasive species are, technically, a part of nature. Animals and plants have constantly been migrating and surviving in different parts of the world when new opportunities for travel are available. And it ends up fine, in the future. The ecosystems being invaded definitely take damage but eventually adapt to the new species. 

So, with all this in mind, are invasive species really that bad? When enough time passes, succession will take place and the ecosystem will bounce back and stabilize, with the ""invasive"" species becoming native. All of the invasive species we've caused all across the world will either die off or adapt and become one with the environment around it. 

All of the invasive species we've caused will eventually evolve into new subspecies, and this will take place all across the world. 

One of my favorite examples is marsupials. Native to South America, they crossed a land bridge to get to Australia and S.E Asia. In the past, we would have considered them invasive. But as they spread out, they adapted to their new surroundings and filled in certain niches. Now, they're considered native species. 

Am I wrong in assuming that humans have caused a similar process to take place? And am I wrong for not caring about (Most) invasive species, as nature will sort itself out eventually? Not all of them are destructive. And perhaps some of these ""invasive species"" will go extinct in their native regions, only to flourish in the new ones we've provided them with. Who are we to say that that's wrong?",Are invasive species really that bad in the long-term?

biology,"Something I've been wondering about recently. I like to learn things so please feel free to post your opinions if they're respectful of *everyone* I should preface that I respect everybodies right to identify how they wish and strongly believe that transmen are men and transwomen are women. Even if you do not believe this (despite the clear evidence) it doesn't really hurt you to respect a person's wishes and gender them appropriately.

I've been learning alot recently about the trans experience because it's genuinely something that fascinates me. Not just the psychological experience of trans people, or the fight for basic equally that is clearly lacking, but the real nuts and bolts science. The legitimate feeling that one is born in the wrong body, purely based on psychosocial reasons or as a result of hormone imbalances that effect someone's Psyche. 

I can't disagree that there's legitimate cause for people to believe they were born as the wrong sex, but the argument presented by advocates etc is that gender is a social construct. But if that's the case, how can transgender people exist legitimately? If it is just a construct, it's not ""nature"" that's got it wrong. It just means that you are of the sex you are born into, but wish to present differently because you feel more socially aligned with the other sex? If this is the case, it's a choice that's reinforced by negative feedback loops in the brain or a learned behaviour to be transgender and I've got to say, this doesn't fit the narrative for me.

I guess what I'm really asking, is can the gender is a construct argument really coexist with the idea that someone is ""born in the wrong body""? We certainly see examples of animals adopting the role of the opposite sex in nature when there is a need (think lioness becoming the head of a pride and growing a mane)

I have a degree in a medical field and neuroscience is a large part of that, so I welcome comments from all.",Gender is a construct?

Meanwhile, the founder and CEO of [Faber Futures](https://faberfutures.com/), a biodesign lab, talked about fashion, synthetic biology, and how clothes can be created using bacteria, in [an interview](https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/natsai-audrey-chieza-clothes-out-of-bacteria-interview/) with [HIGHSNOBIETY](https://www.highsnobiety.com/).

The [San Francisco Chronicle](https://www.sfchronicle.com/) [wrote about Atum](https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/This-Bay-Area-company-thought-it-might-not-15434078.php), a Bay Area biotechnology [company](https://www.atum.bio/) that pivoted, during the coronavirus pandemic, to help address a need for the manufacturing of synthetic genes and proteins. Another company that makes DNA (albeit using an advanced method), in France, expanded their [Series B funding to $89M](https://www.dnascript.com/press-releases/dna-script-expands-series-b-to-89m/). [DNA Script](https://www.dnascript.com/) uses enzymes to synthesize DNA, and will soon release a bench-top machine, called [a DNA printer](https://www.dnascript.com/), that can literally print DNA on-site, in under a day. 

[*Chemistry World*](https://www.chemistryworld.com/) ran a [piece](https://www.chemistryworld.com/features/the-function-of-folding/4012081.article) about the scientific quest to develop ‘foldamers’, self-folding molecules that could one day be used to develop more targeted therapies and study how RNA and proteins fold in living cells.

Finally, a [*Scientific American*](https://www.scientificamerican.com/) article [discussed research](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/plants-have-hormones-too-and-tweaking-them-could-improve-food-supply/) on the thousands of hormones found in plants, and how engineers could tweak them to improve crop yield. In [*OneZero*](https://onezero.medium.com/), here on Medium, a [new article](https://onezero.medium.com/scientists-gene-edited-a-cow-to-have-mostly-male-offspring-fe8ddb92bc6) discussed the cows that have been genetically engineered to produce mostly male offspring.

# Peer-reviewed articles

A slew of peer-reviewed research results were published this week, including a high-resolution of a base editor protein (used for targeted genetic engineering applications) and a machine learning model that can shut down CRISPR in its tracks.

[**Self-Healing Material Made from Squid Teeth Protein**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-020-0736-2)  
A joint effort from the [Sitti](https://www.is.mpg.de/~sitti) and [Demirel](http://www.personal.psu.edu/mcd18/) labs, of the [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/) and [Penn State University](https://news.psu.edu/story/626375/2020/07/27/research/soft-robot-actuators-heal-themselves), respectively, have developed a biosynthetic, self-healing material using proteins found in squid teeth. Published in the prestigious journal, [*Nature Materials*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-020-0736-2)*¹*, the material can heal itself in about one second, far faster than previous self-healing materials used in soft robotics. The study was picked up by several news outlets and organizations, including the [U.S. Army](https://www.army.mil/article/237581/army_project_turns_to_nature_for_help_with_self_healing_material) and [*The Times*](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/squid-teeth-to-help-make-self-repair-suits-c6qnxnbpq).

[**Structure of DNA Base Pair Editor, ABE8e, is Resolved**](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6503/566)  
At UC-Berkeley, the [Doudna](https://doudnalab.org/) laboratory published a 3.2-angstrom resolution structure of the ABE8e base editor bound to DNA in the journal [*Science*](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6503/566)*²*. ABE8e can convert A•T base pairs in the genomes of living cells to G•C, at a rate much faster than previous base editors. This base editing protein was originally created by the [Liu lab](https://liugroup.us/) at Cambridge’s [Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/). To read more about the high-resolution ABE8e structure, check out the [UC-Berkeley press release](https://news.berkeley.edu/2020/07/30/new-understanding-of-crispr-cas9-tool-could-improve-gene-editing/).

[**Anti-CRISPR Proteins Designed Using Machine Learning**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17652-0)  
The [Koonin lab](https://irp.nih.gov/pi/eugene-koonin) at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), in Bethesda, Maryland, used machine learning to design anti-CRISPR proteins, molecules that can inactivate CRISPR-associated proteins, which may have applications in turning off unwanted, genetic edits in living cells. The study was published in [*Nature Communications*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-17652-0)*³*.

[**A New Tool for Tracing Cellular Lineages**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0614-0)  
An exciting area of research in synthetic biology in the last few years has been lineage tracing, in which researchers “trace” the genetic ancestry of each cell in an organism. In principle, one could watch a handful of cells develop into a fully-fledged animal, and determine where each of the cells in the fingers, toes, and tongue came from. Now, researchers at the [Research Institute of Molecular Pathology](https://www.imp.ac.at/), in Vienna, have developed an improved lineage tracing tool, called CaTCH, which uses a modified form of CRISPR to both identify, and isolate, extremely rare cell clones from the millions of cells in a population. The work was published in [*Nature Biotechnology*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0614-0)*⁴*.

[**Tracking Gene Levels in Living Cells**](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30868-0?rss=yes)  
A [group at the University of Pennsylvania](https://rajlab.seas.upenn.edu/) developed a method called MemorySeq which uses RNA sequencing to identify “slowly fluctuating gene expression states in rare single cells”. Published in the journal [*Cell*](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(20)30868-0?rss=yes)*⁵*, the method could possibly be used to quantify “non-genetic heritability” of cellular states.

[**Controlling Neoantigens in Mice; Applications for Studying Cancer**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0613-1)  
Researchers at [Yale](https://medicine.yale.edu/profile/nikhil_joshi/) and [MIT](https://jacks-lab.mit.edu/lab/news) have figured out a way to induce the expression of neoantigens — antigens that have not been previously recognized by a person’s immune system, often from a mutation in a tumor — in living mice. The method, called NINJA, was published in [*Nature Biotechnology*](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0613-1)*⁶* and could help scientists study how T-cells, a type of immune cell, behave during organ transplantation, autoimmune diseases, and cancer.

biology,"I really wish I could have linked to where I got this from, but I remember the basic logic and premises of the argument:

1. a lot of ""prey"" animals could easily overpower their predators with vastly superior numbers if they fought as a group, but don't due to a fear. While not technically at the top of the food chain, humans dominate because they murder whatever gets in their way rather than fleeing.
2. If a lion brings down a gazelle's offspring, it's not going to have its throat slit in the middle of the night. On the other hand, if a lion eats a human child their parents will make it their personal mission to kill as many lions as possible. 
3. Revenge as a survival strategy is a long-term gain for short-term loss: taking on a larger risk to permanently deal with a problem rather than just escape it again. A family of 10 gazelles stays alive by running away and losing the slowest member to the lion. The family of 10 humans stays alive by fighting the lion and losing 2 members in the fight, but they've permanently eliminated the threat.

All of this is a very interesting idea if true, but I haven't been able to find good sources on it.","I've heard that revenge is a survival adaptation by humans. Is this true, and do other animals have this strategy/trait?"

biology,"Hi, I’m currently attending school and will be getting my bachelors degree in biology this December. I’m doing the research and finding out what I need to do to apply. I really want to go somewhere where I will be fully funded and can focus on my schoolwork, because working a job while getting my undergrad has had an impact on my grades. I really just want someone who is knowledgeable in the area to review my qualifications and tell me what they think.

My GPA right now is at a 3.2, and I am expecting it to go up slightly because I’m working much less in the fall and will focus on school more. I’ve got about three cases of course based research:
1) in my microbiology lab I made a dilution series of the gut biome in a leech I extracted from a lake and ultimately isolated the DNA and identified the bacteria. I don’t have a paper for this one because it was a five week summer course and the professor didn’t require it.
2) in my ecology lab, we (as a class) observed the plant and rock etc. distribution in a nearby area and did a series of soil tests to draw conclusions on what plants grew where. It was a lot of that type of stuff. I have a paper I wrote for this one but the professor had everyone use the same methods section she provided since it was done with many many people.
3) in my genetics lab we were in the process of testing water samples to see if there were diatoms affecting it from a recent forest fire. The coronavirus put this class online before we were really able to finish and I don’t have any research paper for it. 

I have not yet taken the GRE but a lot of schools I’m interested in don’t require it anyway. I am required to take it before I graduate though and will be providing it to schools who accept it. I’m a pretty terrible test taker but I’m hoping I can do okay on it.

So, mainly, I’m just looking for advice and your honest opinions. Does it look like I’ve done enough for my application to stand out?

I built this one to reference only banned books by the likes of Chomsky or dozens of banned books on the occult or current situations....

I have a BS in biological sciences and since graduating I've felt a little... Fickle. I never did any internships or summer work during college for financial reasons and have been trying to bulk up my skills and experience working in low-experience requirement positions since graduating. I've worked as a Marine Mammal Observer or Protected Species Observer for the past year, and this past summer field season I've been employed by the state as a fish technician counting salmon on sonar. I don't feel like marine mammals or fisheries are quite the niche that I want to work in though. 

My plan has been to work as a tech and explore my other interests - mainly terrestrial biology, ornithology, or marine invertebrate biology. I am extremely passionate and interested in ecological studies and things like predator-prey dynamics, population ecology, etc. I've had a professor and one older coworker tell me that it can be hard to break into other branches of biology after undergrad though and that a resume that shows such broad strokes can be detrimental to getting hired. Ultimately, I want to pick one branch and then go study that in a Master's program, preferably in British Columbia in the next few years. 

My question to you all is What kind of path did your career take? Do you know more successful biologists that just picked a branch and stuck to it, maybe waiting for opportunities to expand their areas of study later in their careers, or is there something to be said for taking my time and exploring different routes?

biology,"Hello. I have recently completed an MS in applied mathematics, which was immediately preceded by a BS in mathematics and physics. The MS was originally going to be a PhD in mathematical biology. I left at the MS level for several reasons, but only one of them is relevant to this question. The mathematical biologists that I wanted to work with were doing a lot of research that looked more-or-less like this: they would set up a PDE (partial differential equation), either solve or prove something about that PDE, and then basically call it a day. In many cases, there was never any comparison to data, or really any reason to believe that the PDE would actuallly be useful to doing biology -- typically it was just constructed to match one or two qualitative features of the data. In the cases that I am thinking of, their work could not have been used to predict any results in an experiment (at least, to my knowledge), which is basically the goal of science. So, in my view, they weren't really doing biology.

&amp;#x200B;

My point here is not to bash mathematical biology, or to suggest that all mathematical biology is as I have just described -- I know that is not true. Basically, I'm trying to set up the question: how can someone with my proclivity towards mathematics / quantitative work best contribute to biology (and especially personalized medicine, which is my main interest). I did some work in computational biophysics during undergrad, and that was dramatically more applied / relevant that most of what I saw in grad school. So, I know there's a spectrum here, and I have looked at fields such as bioinformatics, biostatistics, physical biology, and bioengineering in addition to mathematical biology and biophysics. 

&amp;#x200B;

So here, finally, is the question: In the opinion of you biologists out there, where can a math-oriented person best contribute? Is there a lot of substantive interaction between biostatisticians and biologists? That could be a good area for me. How about biophysics? I actually have some experience there, but never made it to a conference (so I don't know much about the biophysics/biology overlap). I have heard a lot about bioinformatics lately, so should I develop my software skills? Maybe I'm thinking about this the wrong way, and some math bio groups really do biology, use actual data, etcetera. I'd be interested in just about any insights you have.

&amp;#x200B;

P.S. All other things being equal, I would like to work in personalized medicine.

In the first tube, we add the substance A(Let’s say that’s Dimethyl Sulfate). This substance breaks the chain by the Guanine nucleotides. Later when we add the hole solution of test tube 1 to the acrylamidic gel and the electrophoresis begins the shorter DNA fragments go down to the positive pole. We then do autoradiography to reveal only markt with P32 at the 5‘ end fragments(so we know that they have the original beginning of the pre fragmented DNA chain). My question is here, why are there even different length chains revealed after the autoradiography? If dimethyl sulfate breaks the chain by every Guanine nucleotide weren’t there supposed to be only let’s say 5 nucleotides long chains (if we say that the first Guanine nucleotide is at the fifth position from the P32 marked end)?

biology,"I had the idea of getting some of the organisms currently thought to consume plastic and having a kind of home plastic compost bin. I have a few questions about it though which I've not been able to find answers for.

Firstly, it seems some organisms might not break down (I think the term is mineralise) the plastic but rather just sort of shred it into smaller plastics/microplastics. I think for my project I'd probably want to avoid these.

There's also many different kinds of plastics and some break down more readily than others. I'm not a chemist or biologist so I'd probably need some advising here (I am interested in science so any insight into what this process looks like on a chemical/biological level is always cool).

The organisms I've come across are Idionella Sakaiensis, which is sold here (not sure which country that's from or how legit it is):

https://catalog.bcrc.firdi.org.tw/BcrcContent?bid=81045

And Aspergillus Tubigensis which I've found on one website you can buy online but appears to be about £300. 

Has anyone any experience with growing these organisms/doing this kind of thing? What environments do they like best/how easy are they to cultivate?

Are there any other organisms that would do a better job than these two and/or which are more readily available?

Initially I thought I might have a community of various organisms as some might break down the plastic into a form that others can work with, but I don't know if they'd live well together. I heard once that some fungi and bacteria are really competitive and kind of chemically attack each other and this is why we can get some antibacterial drugs from fungi, because fungi use antibacterials already against their bacterial foes. Nature is great. Greature. 

Never done anything like this before so any input would be appreciated. Maybe it'd be like releasing the grey goo growing these things in our plastic world.

Initially we have a population with say, 1 PP and 11 pp and we let the people pair up and have four children per pair. The next generation has 4 Pp and 20 pp. The proportion of those with the trait has increased.

From here, if Pp only breed with pp, the ratio stays constant but if a Pp breeds with a Pp, the ratio increases and a PP is produced which then reproduces and increases the ratio again.

Seemingly, the proportion of those with the trait can only increase (assuming no loss of reproductive capacity) so why does it not take over the population? What am I missing here?",How can dominant traits be rare?

However implantation almost exclusively occurs with the polar side in humans so it doesn't seem arbitrary at all.

But my idea is if you got a HUGE terrarium, like a house or two sized one and filled it with either: (please bear with me Im super high and want to know if this is even a thought of idea I googled but I don't know how to  put it into simpler words.)  
A. an Environment where one species of insects is fed and taken care of over time, but air inside is a bit more saturated with oxygen, or at least find a mixture of air similar to an Earlier Permian period's Atmosphere which IDK if thats even possible. And then Record the results, finding if they get larger over generations. (this will have to be a quickly reproducing species that can still be at least monitored if not have a few generations to measure)  


B. An Environment with a totally self-sustaining ecosystem that can be monitored, again same variables with the Atmosphere. It would have predator and prey insects along with scavengers and other fauna. Obviously flora will be present in both i just didnt list it.

He claims that this nerve connects the brain to larynx, and instead of going few inches on a direct route, because evolution is blind and stupid, the nerve makes a giant detour around the heart, and therefor it is redicilously longer than it needs to be.

But I decided to [look into that](https://www.imaios.com/en/e-Anatomy/Anatomical-Parts/Right-recurrent-laryngeal-nerve), and I discovered that the RLN doesn't only connects to the larynx, but also to 4 additional organs on its route (cardiac plexus, esophagus, tranchea and constrictor pharyngis inferior). Also the RLN doesn't start at the brain, but near the heart.

biology,"Posted this to r/immunology but it got absolutely no traction, so maybe you guys could help me.

TLDR: Why is the Hepatitis B vaccine administered so soon to babies while the vaccines for other also serious diseases are not? What is beneficial about a Hepatitis B vaccine for a baby with a still-undeveloped immune system?

This is directly related to a video in which the speaker claims that babies are vaccinated on their first day of life. I know that babies’ immune systems reach maturity at around 6-9 months, so that seemed really strange to me.

On the CDC website, I found that generally vaccines are given after 6 months - sometimes after 2 months, but those seem to require booster shots later. The only exception was the Hepatitis B vaccine, which is recommended to be given soon after birth. 

I found a bunch of great articles about infant immune systems ([including this one](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3021731/)), but none of them stated exactly why receiving the Hep B vaccine would be directly advantageous for infants.

So, my question is: Why? What makes it effective for this vaccine to be given so soon after birth, rather than at 6 months or later? Why don’t other vaccines share this property? Why aren’t the vaccines for other diseases also prioritized in this way?",Infant immunity and the Hep B vaccine?
biology,"Hello everyone,

I was curious what branches of math one should know before enrolling in a college level biology 1 course.

Is it heavily recommended that I know the ins-and-outs of statistics &amp; pre-calc (a friend who's further along their pre-med journey **recommended** that I complete math courses first, as they believe it is foundational for bio/chem/physics). I currently do not know those branches of math *well* &amp; want to set myself up for success.

biology,"When  a person attempts to lose weight, they must consume fewer calories than  they burn.  Usually this is done by greatly reducing the fat content of  one's diet to create a calorie deficit.

It  may seem counter-intuitive that a person could eat fatty, high calorie  junk food like pizza, chicken wings, etc. and still lose weight - these  foods are thought of as being synonymous with weight gain.  But in  theory, if a person ate one high fat meal every day, could they still  lose weight as long as they maintained a calorie deficit? (For example,  if a person ate a basket of chicken wings to satisfy their caloric  needs, and ate exclusively vegetables, fruits, and other low calorie  foods the rest of the day to satisfy their nutritional needs).  And if  so, would such a diet have other potential negative consequences?

There are two potential pitfalls to this strategy I can think of:

* First,  eating fatty foods on a regular basis could throw off your microbiome.   As I understand it, gut flora that feed on fats will increase in  population size with the increased supply of fats, and will send signals  to the brain that cause cravings for fatty foods, thus increasing fat  consumption and potentially throwing off your calorie deficit.
* Second,  what about clogged arteries?  If a person is eating fatty foods that  are high in cholesterol, is it possible to simultaneously be in a  calorie deficit and have excess plaque build up in blood vessels?  Or  would the amount of fat necessary to cause artery problems be impossible  to eat without also leading to weight gain?","Is it possible to eat a diet of extremely fatty foods and still lose weight?

I am at a crossroads and have to take a decision quickly as I am running out of time.

The program at Heidelberg is in collaboration with the DKFZ, the German Cancer Research Institute which is one of the best cancer research institutes in the world. 

I am confused between the two programs as while I am really interested in cancer research I am having second thoughts as to if it would be a wise decision to take a deep dive in cancer research early on. I feel that pursuing a highly specialized field would restrict my career options later and it would be hard to switch to other scientific areas. In comparison, Molecular and Cellular Biology is really diverse, will give me a lot of options to pursue research in related fields such as Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine, Developmental Biology, Genetics etc. and I can always shift to cancer biology. I feel as a recent graduate I don't have a lot of hands on experience and it would be best to explore different research areas before I commit to a specific field, especially something as challenging as cancer biology.

Also I belong to India and I am concerned that there are not a lot of career prospects in cancer research here should I decide to return to my country in the future.

Then I decided to visit an ENT Dr. He said I had minor damage in my middle ear (eustachian tube). I then went to a dentist because I read somewhere that having some type of mouth un-alignment could be a cause of the tinnitus. Everything looked good after getting x-rays done.

I'll go through a period of hearing it but then it will go away (as long as I'm staying consistent with my daily plan). After doing a lot of research here are some things that works for me:

\- warm cup of water or milk with half a spoon of turmeric powder. It plays a vital role as an anti-inflammatory! I have a strong feeling drinking this might have helped me significantly!!! I recall when I first started drinking this before bed, I would wake up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom but didn't notice the tinnitus at all. I make sure to drink 2 cups per day (once during the day and once at night)

\- eating pineapples daily

\- eating blueberries daily

\- eating greens daily with meal. Every time I have lunch and dinner I'll make sure to eat spinach leaves and/or brocolli

\- nasal spray 2-3 times a day. I noticed a difference within almost 2 weeks

\- try really hard to stay busy and everything you do/everywhere you go make sure your surrounded with noise (I know that's everywhere) lol. By doing that, you are slowly programming your brain to forget that you have tinnitus.

\- meditating helps me stay in control, focused, and centered

I am well aware that for some people the tinnitus is a lot stronger. I am just speaking to my experience and its very minor.

I really really hope and pray this helps everyone!!",Tinnitus relief

biology,"Nobody probably cares in the slightest shape or form but for my final biology project we had to right a CER (claim, evidence, reason) as to why Trump's claim of COVID-19 being made in a lab was false. I was really proud of my response and just wanted to share it with someone other than my teacher so here it is. Give feedback if you like!

Claim: Covid-19 was not made in a lab.

Evidence: Two features of the virus, the mutations in the RBD portion of the spike protein and its backbone are distinct to COVID-19. The backbone doesn’t look like any disease-causing virus, and other key parts of the virus are new to science. The tip of the COVID-19 spike is unlike anything scientists have seen before, sharing only a single key amino acid with SARS. The high-affinity binding of the COVID-19 spike protein to human ACE2 is most likely the result of natural selection on a human or human-like ACE2 that permits another optimal binding solution to arise. Scientists discovered the genetic similarities of COVID-19 and other coronaviruses run deep: The virus shares 80% of its genes with the previous SARS virus and 96% of its genes with bat coronaviruses. They also demonstrated the virus can get into and hijack cells the same way SARS did, using human or human-like ACE2. RaTG13 bat virus remains the closest to COVID-19 across the genome, but some pangolin coronaviruses exhibit strong similarity to COVID-19 in the RBD, including all six key RBD residues. A [paper published in the journal Nature Medicine](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9) on March 17 assessed the genome of the virus in great detail, coming to similar conclusions to the preprint, categorically stating that it arose due to natural evolution. ""Our analyses clearly show that COVID-19 is not a laboratory construct or a purposefully manipulated virus,"" wrote the collaboration of researchers from institutions across the US, UK and Australia.

Reason: A mutation is an alteration in the nucleotide sequence in bases of DNA or RNA in a genome. COVID-19’s genetic material is made of RNA. RNA is a single-stranded nucleotide sequence. For some viruses like COVID-19, RNA is its genetic code. These types of viruses are more susceptible to mutations since during replication, being single-stranded, when the nucleotide sequence replicates incorrectly, there isn’t a corresponding strand of nucleotide sequences being binded to the RNA therefore, the error will most likely go unseen. In order to create a virus in a lab, the scientists would need to use a virus that already exists and alter the nucleotide sequence in the genes which would create different proteins that have different functions. There would be similarities between the virus that was used to create COVID-19. But since the COVID-19 spikes and backbone are completely different from anything scientists have seen, this points to mutations and natural selection. Natural selection, which is a factor of evolution states that organisms that have traits and characteristics that are better adapted to their environment are more likely to survive and reproduce, this is known as “survival of the fittest”. The virus that COVID-19 is derived from had a random mutation while replicating that allowed it to have these spikes and backbone that was more fit to survive and replicate in the environment it was in, which would’ve been in a human cell or animal cell that had human-like ACE2 receptors. Since the virus was in an environment where it was better adapted to survive, it rapidly reproduced which caused the spike protein that could bind to human or human-like ACE2 receptors to become more common in the virus thus creating COVID-19.  Since COVID-19 has features completely different from any other virus and random mutations cannot be done in a lab, COVID-19 couldn’t have been made in a laboratory and must be the result of natural selection. Speciation is another factor of evolution. Speciation is the evolutionary process by which populations evolve to become distinct species, or in this case a different strand. Since COVID-19 shares 80% of its genes with SARS and 96% of its genes with bat coronaviruses, they are related and COVID-19 must have evolved from one of them and became so different that it became its own strand with its own new features through repeated random mutations and separation of the viruses. One tool scientists use to look for evidence of evolution is similar genome sequences. The more similar the genome sequence between two organisms are, the more closely they are related. The sequence of nucleotides in a genome determines what proteins are made. Since there are some pangolin coronaviruses that have strong similarity to COVID-19 in the RBD, including all six of they key RBD residues, this shows that it is possible for this genome sequence to occur naturally through evolution in nature without the need of scientists in a lab to create them. Assessing the virus's genome is a good way to determine if the virus was made naturally through evolution or in a lab. By looking at the genome they are able to see if any genes were inserted from another virus or removed from the genome in order to create the proteins that gave COVID-19 the features that it has. They can also compare the genome to the genomes of other coronaviruses to look at similarity and differences between them. Also, the review of the genomes of COVID-19 was done by various researchers from various institutions which increases the validity of their conclusions. With all of the evidence of the structure and function of COVID-19 pointing towards evolution of the virus, COVID-19 could not have been made in a lab.",A high school project thingy.

biology,"Hi, I'm designing a high school biology lesson about environmental factors that affect phenotype development (basically, the nurture part of nature vs. nurture), as a follow-up to a lesson about sex determination as part of a genetics unit.  Since it is coming after a lesson about genetic sex, and as a genderqueer individual who wants to do my part to support queer individuals from a non-partisan perspective, I am using gender as my example of something that is controlled by both genetics and by environmental factors.

I am wondering if anybody can point me towards scientific resources that rule out genes as the only cause of gender?  I was able to find some good examples for how we can rule out that culture is the only cause of gender--toy studies in monkeys and humans.  I just need resources now for how we can also show that gender still has a cultural component.

What I would like to do in my lesson is have my students think about how they became ""male"" or ""female,"" and how society may have enforced gender norms onto them.  After that, they will watch 2-3 short videos.  Two of the videos are about the toy studies, which show that male monkeys and human babies have strong preferences for trucks (showing that genetics play a role in gender).  I'd also like to show them a video about ways that we still think culture influences gender.  Next, they will learn about some other traits influenced by the environment like height, language, musculature, fashion, etc.  Then they will brainstorm ways in which the environment shaped who they are today, and then apply what they learned in an activity that I'd rather not waste your time explaining.

My mom has up and down experiences in her left ear including severe ear infections during her childhood and it was left untreated because her parents could not afford a doctor during that time. This affected her hearing. She cannot hear on her left ear anymore, her eardrum is already damaged so bad. Fast forward, Way back 2005 when she's 37 years old, she has fungi in her left ear and it happens all the time with infections and her doctor told her she needs surgery because she suspected that my mom's left ear has cholesterol granuloma. My mom refused, she is really scared of surgeries.

8 years later in 2013, something bad happen. She is just cleaning her ears when the blood runs from her left ear it was like a nose bleed. It is not painful but the blood is flowing non stop from her left ear. She was rushed into the hospital and treated. She undergone CT Scan and the doctor found out that her cholesterol granuloma is really aggressive and needed to go on a emergency surgery before it is too late. That cyst already damaged a lot of her tissues near from her brain. After all of the things happened she survived the operation. Right now, after 7 years since that operation. She told me that her left ear is itchy and I take a look over it and I found white substance it was like fungi. She panicked again and we appointed her on a doctor but it is a struggle because of this pandemic. By tomorrow she will see her doctor.

***Will that cholesterol granuloma regrow? How to avoid it? I am worrying about my mom a lot. I don't want to lose her. She almost died struggling with that disease. I inherited her ear problems and I am taking rid of it but also; my left ear is already damaged, my hearing is bad.***",Can a cholesterol granuloma regrow?

biology,"Hello All.

This is a question I had for my personal research, not meant to be a riddle, but it happens to take that form I guess.

Givens:
A and B are the unknown entities here. They can be organisms, parts of a cell, cycles of an ecosystem, or any natural phenomena that fits below.

A gathers nutrients
A cannot directly use those nutrients

A and B are involved some process where B can change the nutrients into A's better functionality for gathering more nutrients


Some notes I'd like to add:
I tried to keep this as unbiased and bare bones as possible, for any variety of answers.
Feel free to ask follow up questions if anything is unclear.
All answers are welcome! This is a project I really enjoy and would do further research on regardless. 

This originates from a video game series that seems to imply natural phenomena, although it's not explicitly stated.
It can be speculated that the nutrient is CO2, due to the player only being able to take it in (what seems like) a gaseous state. Or it can be found in white solid clumps (perhaps dry ice) - where the player can turn these into a gas and absorb them as nutrients.

biology,"Hi all,

Last year, I reported being inappropriately touched by a postdoc. I was forced to talk to my institutions Title IX office after coming forward, trying to get out of the lab I was in. It was reported to the PI on three occasions. The lab tech was also inappropriately touched. Several people saw this. Yale did not attempt to substantiate those claims. He also made inappropriate comments to a female undergrad that had been there previously. This was a pattern. First, when I told the PI about that, she laughed and said she, ""didn't get involved in personal matters"". The second time, we were standing in the lab, and I even asked the technician as well in front of her if she liked it when he came up and grabbed her from behind while she said 'no' and 'stop' repeatedly and tried to squirm away. She said she didn't like it. PI did nothing. Third try, I reframed it as a hinderance to my data. PI said she had NEVER HEARD OF THESE ALLEGATIONS BEFORE (lie) and only when her data could be affected did she do anything. When I reported this, I was made to stay out of the lab for two months-not the handsy post doc. Institution admitted that they knew I was touched, and said ""steps were taken to prevent a recurrence"". Nothing changed. We still had overlapping schedules. He's still there. When I opened the title IX report today, I was shocked to see that Yale said the claim was unsubstantiated. There were emails sent to other PIs questioning the conduct and relaying PIs response, consistently. Others who knew who the office said they wouldn't contact. This directly conflicts with what the investigators told me. I was told by two different investigators that they COULD substantiate my claims. That they had done something to prevent future incidents. Tonight, I opened their title IX report. I found mine easily.

They lied in their report. They didn't take it seriously. They have a national reputation for not taking harassment seriously, and it's spot-on.

My former PI said it sounded more like assault. I went nuclear and put it all on Twitter. No ragrets. Not even a single letter.

It's with the OCR and NIH, so I'm protected by federal whistleblowing laws.

Today, the OCR attorney called my attorney just now and he was in the room when Yale admitted I was touched by this postdoc. They openly falsified their title IX report. They played themselves. This is it-they're sunk.

I'd like this to get some more traction. If you can, I'd appreciate any retweets I could get. My handle is: DeathCab4Callie

biology,"Hi everyone! I am a rising senior studying Molecular and Cell Biology and Global Health at UCSD. I was wondering if I could get some advice regarding career options in biology? I have been pre-med since my freshman year but after doing some research and talking with professors I opened myself up to the possibility of working in research, industry, academia, and pretty much anything.

I was in a research lab and doing some hospital internships, but due to the pandemic I obviously cannot partake in any of those. Since applications are going to come up soon and I need to decide to study for the MCAT, GRE, etc. I feel like the time is collapsing and I need to make a decision without very much experience. I am first-gen transfer student and don't have a lot of people to reach out to for advice on this. UCSD also has options to do an Honors thesis, BS/MS program for biology, and also a 1 year MA in Global Health. My graduate tuition at CA state schools is covered through a grant I receive until I'm 27. However, if I decide to get a PhD I think taking the 1-2 years for the Master's will not be useful especially since my GPA is high enough to get into graduate schools. I do not have any publications which is what I am worried about, and I heard that most PhD programs now look for published students, which is a reason to perhaps pursue a Masters before PhD. I've also considered working as a research tech/assistant, but I'm not sure if this is a good career long term and eif I eventually will need more than a bachelors to move up. What do you think?

biology,"I graduated 3 years ago with a BS in biology. When I started college, I was naive and trusted the course advisors when I talked to them about degree options. I told them I wanted something versetile, something I could have a career in without grad school, but also something that would get me into grad school. At the time I wanted to be a doctor. My parents never went to college and couldnt offer me any advise. The advisors said a biology degree is exactly what I need. 2 years into my 5 year under grad, I began suffering severe mental health issues that cause my grades to fall. I graduated with a 3.0, and didnt have the psychological capacity to go pursue grad school. When I decided to fall back on alternate career options, I discovered that there were none. I didnt know what to do, so I finished school, hoping I'd have something figured out by then. 

I currently work as a dental assistant and make $16 per hour. I'm putting 75% of my paycheck to cover 60k of student loan debt. I watched all of my peers and friends move on to amazing careers and grad schools. I'm nearly 26, and feel like I have nothing to show for my time in school, and dont have a future. 

I put blood, sweat, and tears, into finishing my degree, and all it has done is put in in debt that's holding me back from life. I dont want to be bordering on low income my whole life. I know I'm smart and am capable for a lot more and being a dental assistant my whole life. 

I'm open to going back to school for another 2 years, but no grad school will take me with a mediocre GPA (and many retaken classes), and I dont have the time and money to redo undergrad. I want to start a family when in 30 and dont want to be deep in debt and homework with a baby.

biology,"Hi, I'm trying to start a project based on R where I input cancer patient data to find DEG's to ultimately search for possible pharmaceutical targets. My focus is can I can input the same data into GSEA and DEG to confirm each other's conclusions. Right now, I'm only using DEG (voom+limma package in R) to filter/select significant genes.

I know that these two analyses are completely different- GSEA takes in a priori gene sets and gives information relevant to significant gene SETS for each phenotype. DEG will look into individual GENES (not gene sets) and gives us a list of differentially expressed genes for each phenotype.

However, I was wondering if these can work together in harmony so that we can first use GSEA to filter significant gene sets and then use DEG to test individual genes significantly enriched in those gene sets of GSEA. I thought this would help because just performing DEG inherently lacks biological significance. But while GSEA has biological significance, it doesn't have the ability to detect at the level of individual genes. So why not make them work together to complement each other's strengths/weaknesses?

For example, I would run GSEA for two different cancer types (phenotype) A and B, and find gene set X is overexpressed. Then I would look into which group of individual genes are contributing the most to the enrichment score for gene set X. Then I would run a DEG analysis of those individual genes. If I find some genes that are significantly overexpressed for specific types of cancers, that actually itself can be a probable target.

I also do recognize the difficulty of running this together- there are so many different packages that have different methods (ex. normalization methods, etc). But putting these problems aside, I'm just asking that if I could get this right, would this be a good idea?

Thank you for your input :)",Combining GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment analysis) and DEG (Differentially Expressed Genes) to confirm results together- is it a good idea?

I've been following some of the vaccine trials, and Moderna is one that has been making some larger news lately, and they are recruiting people for a phase 3 trial (in which I live in an area where I might sign up).

As an aspiring scientist...and potential candidate, I'm asking around the science community if they could help me understand the trial, vaccine, and have an informative discussion (rather than blindly believing the media).

Published results from the phase 1 trial: [https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2022483)

Some questions I have...please feel free to answer some or all! Any insight is appreciated

1. Does  a greater antibody response necessarily mean improved immunity? Doesn't  the trial ultimately have to involve some viral-exposure component (ie.  subjects that received vaccine are then exposed to virus, and then  measure immune response) to prove effectiveness?
2. How  does an mRNA vaccine work? My understanding is that the mRNA of the  spike protein is injected, which creates antibodies...but how?
3. What  is a pseudovirus neutralization assay? Does it use a nonactive virus to  see if it infects the subject? Is it an invivo or invitro thing?
4. In terms of an effective immune response, should we be focusing more on antibodies or T cell/CD8+ response? Or perhaps both? Most media seem to only harp on antibodies...
5.  The fact that the trial  is at phase 3, I'm assuming, means that there's a greater chance that  the vaccine is effective rather than not, and is safe rather than not.  Is this a fair assumption? Would you feel comfortable signing up for  this clinical trial?",Understanding the Moderna COVID Vaccine Trial...what do the results actually mean?

Title: New Weapons to Fight Antibiotic Resistance

Where: twitch.tv/thinkswithtwitch

When: Thursday 7/16, 545PM PST, Talk starts at 6PM PST

Abstract: The ability to manage bacterial infections with the discovery and development of antibiotics was arguably one of the most important advancements in modern medicine. This advancement is now being threatened by the rise of antibiotic resistant bacteria. New solutions are urgently needed and despite the fact that phage therapy has frequently been touted as one of those new solutions, there are no approved phage therapeutics on the market. Here we briefly discuss how we ended up in this situation and the key technical challenges that have prevented phage therapy from living up to its potential. We outline a path to overcoming these technical challenges and bringing phage therapy to the market as a powerful solution to help us manage bacterial infections and save lives in an age of antibiotic resistant bacteria.",New Weapons to Fight Antibiotic Resistance

biology,"Does stress really make your hair grey? 

It is often cited as being true, but now there is evidence that it is definitely true. 

A recent Nature paper elegantly describes that RTX, a compound similar to the active ingredient in chili peppers, causes grey hair formation. 

In addition, the researchers show that the mechanisms behind this is linked to noradrenaline and its release in the fight-or-flight response. This might come as a surprise but actually it makes sense when considering that an octopus is able to change colour in stressful situations for example.

The question remains whether this mechanism is similar to hair greying induced by again, but at least there is hard evidence to proof that stress can make you look old!

biology,"Hey guys, maybe my question is a little different since I'm not from the United States. But anyway, I'd like some guidance and tips. I'm applying for the entrance exam and I'm very undecided about which degree I should choose, I have the option to:

1- Try to get a major in biology, and obviously try a master or doctorate in neuroscience.

2- Try to get a major in a medical course, and have the possibility to start an MD-PhD in the middle of the course. (For you understand better, in my country medical course is a 6' years underg course)

If I try MD, I could start an MD-PhD in the third or fourth year, and in 8 years finish it (an estimate, obviously). 

Education here is free, so there is not much financial costs during undergraduate. 

The problem that I am most undecided is after graduating,  because most of the biologists that I talked, became teachers or unemployed, and the possibility of getting a fellowship is extremely frustrating. 

In the case of M.D, the college I'm applying has many internships and collaborative research opportunities with Harvard, Stanford, etc. For being an elitist course: There are many more opportunities; the most influential professors and researchers at the university work in the medical department.

Also, I'm being from a third world country maybe it can give me more opportunities.

I'm practically going to the medical side more as a safe option after graduating, since I could do a residency in neurology or neurosurgery as well. (I really don't want to become a teacher or work in any other area aside from research/clinical)

I am very interested in this part of clinical research, but I also don't mind dedicating myself entirely to academic research. Neuroscience is just one of my passions, and I am interested in several others like biochemistry, cell biology, genetics (which both courses would let me follow)

Talking to a colleague who does MD-PhD, and research in neuroscience, he said that having too much contact with anatomy and neuroanatomy during his first years was essential.  On the other hand, a neuroscientist from my country said that biology is a more complete foundation, because evolution and biochemistry are studied more thoroughly.

I'm very confused about which one to try, and I would like to read some advices about it even if you want to consider the reality of the USA or your country, so I can get a sense.

biology,"Hello, millions of people in the world work in warehouses or fridge rooms that have refrigerator blowers. These blowers use ammonia to cause their reaction and cool the warehouse/room. Now whilst ammonia levels are supposed to be tested regularly, there is a chance that it still gets through in trace amounts that are not able to be smelled or the levels aren't high enough to trigger a test and sound an alarm. There is evidence that people with schizophrenia have higher concentrations of ammonia than a normal person.

\[Source\] -  [https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-20/issue-05/057006/Ammonia-and-ethylene-biomarkers-in-the-respiration-of-the-people/10.1117/1.JBO.20.5.057006.full](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/journal-of-biomedical-optics/volume-20/issue-05/057006/Ammonia-and-ethylene-biomarkers-in-the-respiration-of-the-people/10.1117/1.JBO.20.5.057006.full)

"" It should be pointed out that the mean ammonia level of schizophrenia patients is higher (2.02 ppm) compared to the mean ammonia level of healthy subjects (0.29 ppm) ""

They came to this conclusion after giving the patients a drug which allowed them to test for levels of ethylene and ammonia in the breath. If this is the case, schizophrenic patients have higher blood ammonia levels.

The question that I have. Would long-term exposure to trace amounts of ammonia from the artificial air of industrial refrigerator blowers potentially cause mental decline? I know the lungs and liver filter most of it out. But lets say you are exposed to this quality of air for 40-50hrs per week with no break. Is it possible that the corrosive effects of trace ammonia could cause these effects over a period of years? I know there is extremely little research into this, but it is something that I have thought may be. Thank you!",Possible link between ammonia exposure and mental disease and decline.

Can moving from a dry state to a humid state change your body and make you sweat more?

I lived in Northern Nevada for Gardnerville/Carson City/ Lake Tahoe and Reno  26 years of my life, when I lived in Nevada I only had to shower once a day and put on a stick of deodorant and I would be fine.  I moved to Seattle WA and I notice that even showering once a day and putting on deodorant does not help. Sometimes especially in the summer months, I have to take extra long with my showers and use extra strong deodorant.   

I also noticed that in Nevada my hair was nice and straight and in Seattle my hair is curly.  I did notice when I first moved here I was sweating and had to shower with just a moderate amount of exercise.  Now I don't have to do that.  I have lived in the Pudget sound for about 9 years.  So I am thinking my body has acclimated to the moisture in the air and humidity. 

When I was living in Reno I took a trip to Philidelphia PA.  I was only there for about a week but i was sweating more and had to shower twice a day and use extra strong deodorant.   

My question is, does your body take a while to get accustomed to new environmental factors?  I have been living in Washington State for 9 years and I still feel sometimes that my body has not fully acclimated to the humidity.

biology,"TLDR; Would a DVM-PhD or a PhD set me up for better career opportunities involving animal research?

I am about to be a junior in college, majoring in Cellular and Organismal Physiology. Up until this point I have been preparing for a career in veterinary medicine, but I have gotten cold feet. As I've progressed through college, I've begun to think that maybe I would happier if I could have a research-oriented career in the biological sciences still related to animals. As someone whose parents heavily pushed pre-med, I feel that I've been pressured into choosing pre-vet as a way to justify my interest in animals and biology without completely disappointing them. I've come to realize that it's not necessarily the treatment of animals that excites me the most, but running diagnostics in the lab or working on my undergrad research project.

So here I am, trying to decide where I should go with grad school in order to have a career as a scientist. I still have a passion for animals, but I just don't see myself working a day-to-day clinic job after gaining shadow/work experience. I do have some undergrad research experience, so if I decide to stop pursuing veterinary school I would definitely want to put more effort into growing that experience in lieu of more animal/vet experience hours.

Should I push ahead and try and apply for vet school while trying to earn a PhD on top of that? (I have been eyeing the dual degree programs some schools have) Or should I ditch the thought of vet school altogether and just focus on trying to get into a PhD program? How would I pivot from preparing for a career in vet medicine to one solely focused on biological research?

Times when PCR is so critically important, thought of sharing some tips out of sheer experience! 

1) Sanitize the entire work space and required items thoroughly. 
2) Always aliquot autoclaved water in 1mL eppis and use a fresh one for every run.
3) I always kept all the tip boxes, empty PCR tubes, water, pipettes and basically everything (except genetic material) under UV for 30 minutes to eliminate any chance of genetic material contamination. 
4) Make sure your gloves are intact and not punctured. Do not handle DNA with bare hands. EVER.
5) Always wash wells before loading sample on gel. Never overload the wells. Try to leave an empty well before you load water sample to avoid mixing and show any false bands in water sample. 

It was extremely important for us to reproduce exactly same results as we were filing for a patent and had no scope for any contamination.

In Luigi Galvani’s famous experiments, he took a freshly dead frog, dissected the legs keeping the sciatic nerve intact, and transferred an electric current to the leg, which moved as though it was alive. It has been replicated tons of times since then and now is a standard high school experiment.

I have been in touch with people who work at the slaughterhouse/meat lab at my university. Today, I went there and got a sample of skeletal muscle. I put it in chilled solution promptly to preserve its action potential and contractile function. 

I hooked up the muscle to the circuit. When I pressed the pedal to apply more voltage, the LED in series with the muscle got brighter (indicating that current was flowing through the muscle and that it increased when the pedal was pressed). However, the muscle did not contract at all.

Using the figure i uploaded as an example, let assume we sequence the ""outter"" circular DNA and ,in theoretically, we should find the left side of the genome (leading) has more T and G than the right side of the genome (lagging). One of the reason is that the lagging strand are more susceptible to mutation during replication due to longer exposure to the environment as ssDNA.

Firstly, I know that sexuality is not black and white and it's s continuum of ""feelings"" and other assciated things in the limbic system or other organs etc.

However, there are points on this spectrum where an adult can tell if they are a bi, homo, trans, whatever sexual.

Back to our story.

In the Smith's case that is 1/2 chance of having a gay or bi child if you are a gay/bi yourself. 

What do we now about this phenomenon when two, on the sexuality scale, not very heterosexual people and more bi or gay people, have children.

From purely layman perspective, it should be way rarer for tow black persons to have a blonde child. However, two blonde parents will more likely have blonde children.

I know this topic is seen be many prejudice people as taboo or evil but have some brave people made any studies like that. Are there any studies on this topic of how many children will be non-heterosexual if both parents are not hetero-sexuals?","To what degree is sexuality hereditary, what studies do we have at our disposal"

Pinocytosis occurs when already-dissolved/broken-down liquid particles are taken in, ready to be absorbed. This process includes invagination (forming of pouch by the membrane).

What I don’t understand are:
1. How does the cell knows that the particles they’re about to take in are whole particles or already-dissolved particles?
2. Why do cells form pseudopodia for whole particles and why do cells go through invagination for already-dissolved particles? Why can’t it happen vice-versa?
3. If the vacuole membranes from phagocytosis and pinocytosis in the same cell were formed by the same cell membrane, how do they detect which one has to be broken down and which one is already broken down?

biology,"Hey all. So I'm turning 31 this year, with a recent degree in Media Studies with a concentration in Wildlife Sciences. 

I've found that I have no interest and passion, save for writing, in the media industry and I really would like to switch over to a life sciences field, particularly marine or wildlife biology. Research, conservation and education are my three main interests, and I'm looking at continuing my education in order to accomplish this. I could use some advice on which path to take, though!

1) I could pursue a second undergrad degree and essentially start over from scratch. Take a few remedial courses, get field and lab experience, network and move on to a graduate program afterwards (hopefully with a chance to have it paid for if I do well enough). It'd be less time than my last degree, and cheaper too. It would take longer than trying to go right into grad school, though, and from what I've been reading would do little beyond get me into the field. 

2) I could take remedial courses and get some kind of research experience so that I can compete for grad school somewhere. It'd be nice to not have to get another bachelor's, and I'd be more involved in work that would truly interest me I believe. I worry that I'd be missing out in valuable experience from the undergrad degree though, and would be at a disadvantage compared to more STEM focused graduates. I also doubt I'd get any kind of assistantship/TA position with my non-STEM background so cost would be a concern.  

Some have said that I should focus on doing science communications or wildlife media rather than go into research, but I'm not sure that's right for me. 

I realize that potential salary earnings in life sciences aren't that hot beyond getting tenure, and that's one reason I haven't fully jumped into this path yet. 

Any advice would be appreciated, can answer any questions yall might have!

biology,"So humans are woefully unprepared to go to the stars. We are also badly prepared to deal with having to cram more and more knowledge into our brains. We get old, and more and more of our adult lives are spent in education. 

So... why don't we create a voluntary program that allows humans to selectively breed for longevity?

First, before anyone says ""but eugenics or genetic experimentation or unethical xyz... 

1. purely voluntary. 
2. low cost so that everyone can get in.
3. controls for socioeconomic status, so that life advantages are factored out.
4. No genetic modification. Purely old fashioned natural selection.
5. Yes... this is a human breeding program... but its a voluntary one, and not done in person. -,-

So, here is the proposal. An institute would exist, with cryogenic containers that store sperm and egg samples from every single participant. Participants would be required to donate 5,000 usd to the institute. Over the course of their lives, that 5,000 would be wisely invested in safe conservative investments. (like life insurance) Every year, the participant would contact the institute. If a participant goes for 10 years without contacting the institute, the year at which they stopped contacting is considered the year of their death. 

Then, the institute would perform a matching every single year, selecting solely on age of death. Once matches were selected, the sperm and egg samples would be unfrozen, and test tube babies would be made. Surrogate mothers would be hired using the funds that the biological parents provided. Upon birth, the babies would be placed with foster care families, the institute would then use the funds remaining to ensure that the children were kept safe and sound until adulthood. Then, upon reaching adulthood, the children would be given the remainder of their parent's funds. The children would be free to pursue their own lives, but would be made aware of the institute, and would be given any memorabilia or inheritance that their biological parents provided for them.

The institute has a special upfront clause for both genders though. If you die before the age of 80 for any reason, your funds are forfeit, and your genetic material will be flushed. The institute would be blind to all variables except age of death. 

Tell me your thoughts on this from an ethical, biological, logistical and financial perspective. 

Would you volunteer to maybe have offspring you will never see?

With the COVID crisis that seems like it's going to kick my butt in finding liveable jobs regardless of major. But for my intentions is a General Biology BS good enough to get into these fields? Is it more rigorous/competitive than if I had pursued environmental sciences or wildlife biology? Am I a pursuing this like a complete idiot? 
I'm in my mid 20's going into the worst job market of all time so it's hard to figure out if I'm managing to get it together or not. 

TLDR; Is a Biology BS major good to pursue for someone wanting to work in wildlife/animal related careers, despite the COVID crisis and poor job outlook?",Will I regret a Biology Bs major?

Inside the lipid membrane is the the RNA. I've read that these are all connected with weak covalent bonds but stacked together possibly making the protection of outside contaminants stronger.

biology,"When I say TGF-b inhibitors I mean taking curcumin which inhibits it.

 Reason I ask is because perhaps TGF-b inhibitors would inhibit healing of the tissue if used too early in the healing process? 

 im reading here “Exogenous TGF-beta stimulates the formation of granulation tissue which increases the rate of wound closure in full thickness skin wounds. The chronic expression of TGF beta can stimulate the formation of scar tissue”, am I right in saying this means that you shouldn’t use TGF-β inhibitor  until a wound has closed on the skin/surface? https://www.researchgate.net/post/what_is_the_role_of_TGF-beta_in_wound_healing

In animals, the Mitochondrion make the APT in Krebs cycle and in plants, the Chloroplasts make ATP in the Calvin cycle. The Animal cell 4 complex + ATP synthase and the plant cell 4 part photosystem and ATP synthase seem remarkably similar (to me).

biology,"Hi all! So I am currently a biology major and spanish minor doing my undergrad in Canada. I am going into my second year of school and as of now I am deeply considering the medical path. I have told this to family and a lot of friends and they are very excited for me to follow that path, but now I am starting to second guess my choices. I have a deep love for biology and have started looking more and more into going into research and attending graduate school. I know I still have 3 years left of uni, but the timelines of pathways seem to suggest I should already know what I should do and I am going to be writing my MCAT next summer. I don’t really want to undergo the process of applying to medical schools AND graduate schools at the same time because a) that’s a ton of costs and b) that’s a whole lot of work. I like the idea of medicine because it’s very hands on and engaging, there is always something new (I am interested in emergency, peds, and family). I of course would love a career where I can help others and medicine allows you to see that pretty directly. I also like the idea of research as it really seems like an adventure, and dedicating your life to learning more about the universe excites me just as much. Though I know I would hate being a college professor and feel like I don’t know enough about the job prospects in those fields yet. I know medical school graduates are pretty much guaranteed a job where as there is so much unemployment for grad students, but medical school costs are pretty insane. One thing I know for certain is that I want to continue my education after my bachelors degree regardless. I just don’t want to regret my decision or let anyone down and disappoint my parents. 

Some things to consider: 
- I don’t want to be working under someone my whole life 
- I do want to have some sort of life outside of work
- My GPA after first year wasn’t stellar (3.1) 
- I want to do something to help the world 
- My biology interests are mainly zoology, I don’t think I would love medical research 
- I want to live in the US after I graduate 
- I won’t be getting much financial help from parents at all (not opposed you joining the military if needed but would prefer not if possible)

biology,"Hi guys,

I just want some reassurance that I am correct about my thought process here.

I run a youtube channel called Gumball Degree and I'm making a youtube video about acids and bases in regards to how it reacts in water. I know this sounds slightly more geared to chemistry but my video is currently about biology so I'll ask here. This is how I understand it.

When we introduce NaOH into water, it dissociates into Na+ and OH- ions. According to the Bronsted-Lowry Definition. A base is the molecule that ACCEPTS a proton. But how does it accept a proton when its in water? The answer is that we know that water sometimes have its own reactions between itself. A process that looks like this: 2\*H2O &lt;=&gt; H3O+ + OH-. This reaction usually occursnot often but since NaOH also results in OH- ions, we see that NaOH's OH- ion is able to accept a proton and turn into H2O and this is why NaOH is a base in water. But the overall solution will have plenty of left over OH- because of this",Putting NaOH (base) in H2O? Explaining what NaCO does as a base in water...

75% of plants are edible (300K edible out of 400K according to [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730301-400-the-nature-of-crops-why-do-we-eat-so-few-of-the-edible-plants/](https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22730301-400-the-nature-of-crops-why-do-we-eat-so-few-of-the-edible-plants/))

29% of mushrooms are eddible (according to [http://www.mushroomthejournal.com/greatlakesdata/TopTen/Quest19.html](http://www.mushroomthejournal.com/greatlakesdata/TopTen/Quest19.html))

Now, these numbers may not be too accurate, but there seems to be a marked difference between plants and animals in terms of edibility.

Further, I was told that the most toxic poisons come from mushrooms, not plants.

# Question

Why would mushrooms be more likely (overall) to evolve toxicity (or otherwise make themselves inedible) than plants? Where did this evolutionary pressure come from?

# A Guess

I'm thinking maybe plants have other pressures, like getting energy from the sun, etc. that mushrooms don't have. And, that means the poisonous plant doesn't necessarily survive better than the one that can photosynthesize better.  What do you think?",Why did mushrooms evolve to be more poisonous than plants?

The last time I did maths was at GCSE. When I  started last year, we were doing lots of lab maths skills about stuff like buffers and logarithms. The lecturer staryed talking about differential equations, and laughed and said 'i hope you all know how to do these' and everyone nodded. I had to frantically google what the hell one of those was, and i still didn't understand. Before the seminar, I'd never even heard of logarithms except in passing. Ive gone through using youtube tutorials and websites but I just don't understand how to use them.

Because im sure as hell never going to understand it on my antidepressant fogged brain. The only thing I'm alright at is statistics.

While moving something in the barn I discovered ANOTHER juvenile which rushed to crawl into that same space.  There was nothing I could do so we just moved things away and called it a day. The adult flew away about 30 minutes later and seemed fine so we figured if they were related that evening they’d figure out how to get out.  That PM we didn’t see anyone and hoped for the best.  

On day 3 there was a bat crawling around but away from the barn so I didn’t think they were related but it was odd.  I lost that bat before I could get a stick and didn’t find a dead bat later so I assumed he managed to fly away.  
This past Wednesday (day 5) in the AM we found a dead bat and I took it to get tested for rabies.  Because of the American holiday I assume I won’t know an answer until later next week.   But today I found another dead bat (day 8) this time inside the barn.  
I wonder if this one is a result of the fireworks BUT, the other bat encounters make me suspicious that something is going on with our population. 

This morning we also found a LOT more droppings in the barn from last night so I am assuming a lot of bats came in to take cover from the fireworks??  If anything we definitely had an increase in bat activity last night per all the droppings. 

I suspect the ones we saw are little brown bats (if that helps to know what kind they might be) 
Rabies is of course a worry (I’ve been vaccinated and got a booster to be safe) but my other concern is some disease that could severely hurt our bat population.  

I plan to take the second one to be tested as well but I wanted to post this on here incase someone knows something about diseases in bats.  We are concerned for their safety as well as ours and our horses. 
Anyone have any ideas what could be happening?  

Also fireworks here didn’t really start until around July 1st so I do not believe that the first encounter has anything to do with fireworks.

I am a rising sophomore majoring in Biology.

I had applied to many summer research programs but obviously they too were canceled.  
My goal is to apply to PhD programs and to pursue a career in research. I understand that admissions committees will likely look leniently on this time in light of the Coronavirus pandemic, but I am more concerned about my ability to confirm that research is the career for me prior to applying. With Spring 2020 not being confirmed in-campus, I worry that I may end up with only one year of research experience before starting my applications senior year.

I predict that some universities' labs will open this fall, and I am considering trying to find a lab in driving distance studying something I am interested in.

The problem with infections, cancer etc. is that any sort of treatment you apply selects for the ones best able to tolerate it. So how about you genetically engineer an individual such that it has genes for resistance to an antibiotic, pesticide etc. but these are closely linked to multiple (redundant) kill switch genes (I think we learned about one called Flox or something at uni - basically any gene that is selectively neutral until you activate it). You then put this individual back in with its friends and start treating with the drug you gave it resistance to. It gets a huge competitive advantage and, in a few generations, the entire population has the gene-complex containing the resistance AND the kill switches. You then activate the switches and they’re all dead (this is why you need multiple: in case, by chance, any of them lose the switch but keep the resistance).

biology,"I heard a cryptozoology-related podcast about this case like 2 years ago, after I previously saw a documentary that mentioned this case, and they said later on in his life, he saw a therapist and eventually convinced himself there was no sea dragon, but I'm not sure if that means he made up the story or not.

On March 24, 1962, Edward Brian McCleary, 16, went out to sea with 4 friends to do skin-diving and to investigate the shipwreck USS Massachusetts. He returned alone, and told the other boy's family, rescue crews, and other authorities a terrifying tale.

I remember seeing the sketch he drew and the description and the dragon looked like typical sea dragons in fantasy artwork;

https://www.ebay.com/itm/Art-Wall-Decor-Artwork-Fantasy-Sea-Dragon-Sailboat-Oil-Painting-Prints-On-Canvas-/182824403481

The sole survivor, Edward B. McCleary, stated that the neck was 12 feet tall sticking up vertically out of the surface of the water, and it had elongated teeth. It was no crocodile or fish.

he said he saw it chase and kill 4 of his friends one by one leaving him the sole survivor. He was 16 at the time. This was in 1962. He went into vivid detail about everything from how smooth its neck was, to the shape of its pupils (an oval shape). He also went into morbid detail, such as the length of his friends agonised cries as the dragon was mauling them, one by one.

If I remember correctly, only one body was found. (The body of Bradford Jay Rice, aged 14.)

The names of the other three were Warren Felley, Eric Ruyle, and Larry Bill. They were all from Fort Walton beach, Florida.

Wondering what people's thoughts are on this. This happened approximately one mile from the beach in Pensacola (where I live) harbor, in 20-30 ft deep water. Very close to the USS Massachusetts shipwreck the 5 boys were trying to investigate, before encountering the dragon.

biology,"I'm working on an artificial life simulation and have been working on adding viruses to the ecosystem. 

I'm aware it's not going to be ""realistic"" in many ways, but I'm trying to get some insights to produce interesting results. You can also tell me if a particular point/feature doesn't make sense or would not produce nice results 

&amp;#x200B;

Basically, once they infect a host, my viruses organically grow by producing virions (not even sure it's the right word, sorry if I'm offending anyone, I'm not a biologist, but I'll be using that to describe virus particles) which are then ""used"" in  3 manners that are distributed between through genes (can also be turned off):

&amp;#x200B;

They can use those virions to :

*  Colonize more cells inside the host, which then are scaled to fit a logistic function (x)(1-x)
*  Produce Skin Virions (kind of like sweat) that have a chance of infecting other lifeforms that will come in physical contact with the host
*  Produce Air Virions that float around and have a chance of infecting other lifeforms it touches.

&amp;#x200B;

So the thing is that I'm trying to balance those and other factors and am having a hard time figuring out  good behaviors. A few questions I'm asking myself to which I'm looking for insights in the real behavior of viruses :

&amp;#x200B;

1. Is there a logical cap at which production to the skin/air should stop/slow ? Because as of now it can pretty much accumulate indefinitely and I'm having troubles programming impacts that make sense to me. Let's say the host get completely covered in virions to the points where it forms a complete coating over its skin, what would happen to another agent that would come in contact with it ? How should it differ from only a few particle ? 
2. When those caps are reached/approached, what should be done with the overflow ? Should it be redirected, discarded, damage the health of the host, drain its energy ? etc.   
3. Should I add genes that act as additional negative feedback loop to curb production to one direction depending on the progress toward that ? Exemple : a ""hard"" max to result in logistic accumulation ?
4. Do virus usually have a way to react/interact with their host immune system ? My agents have an immune system controlled by behavioral pathways that can use things like sensed infection level (which presents a delayed value to the ""real"" infection level depending on an agent gene) but also any other evolved pathways to senses or biological signals (exemple : having the immune system evolve to bolster when the agent see a lot of other agents around), but as of now the immune system's only effect is to reduce infection level proportionally to the infection level at the cost of non-linearly damaging the body (a background low-level immune system activation wouldn't do much damage, but a full activation could prove fatal depending on the immune system full strength gene)   
5. Acquired Immunity is incredibly complex in the real world. I don't have it implemented as of now but I feel like it's somewhat important, but I'm struggling to find a way to develop it in ways that would be compatible to a few genes or numbers  

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if that's a little long, but again, I'm mostly looking for insights. And any amount of it on any of those points would be incredibly helpful.

I have been pursuing a degree in biology for about 3 years. In high school I was a depressed burnout, I found science in community college,  and now I have a 3.9 GPA and a paid internship at my school (transferred to a four year this year). I love science and biology but I'm becoming increasingly worried I won't choose a specific path,  and that I won't get a career after college. I don't want a lot of money,  just a job that I can enjoy and maybe travel every once in a while (or even live abroad). Although I see my mentors and professors doing this, I feel like a biology degree won't give me that... perhaps I'm stressing myself out for nothing,  but I can't shake the feeling that I won't be doing a job I love... or even have a job after college. I know that graduate school is pretty much a requirement for stem careers and I am willing to do so.. there is also the money aspect that I am worried about. 

I don't know what else I can do since I'm so deep into my degree and don't know of other interests... this is really worrying me and keeping me up at night, if anyone has advice or their own experiences I would love to hear them, I have intense anxiety right now and cannot see a light at the end of this tunnel.",I need advice...

I’m a musician and writer currently employed as an adjunct professor of jazz piano and theory at two universities, and have worked and taught extensively as a professional musician since I graduated with a bachelor’s of music degree in 2015. I love music and I love teaching, but I don’t love working in music academia. I have felt a pull towards natural sciences and public sector work for years, and quarantine gave me the clarity I needed to re-evaluate what I want to do. I’m fortunate to have the time and flexibility to go back to school sometime soon, and want to make sure that I am as prepared as possible. 

I got decent grades (3.7ish) in high school and my first undergrad, and took AP bio and chem in HS and oceanography in college. Other than that, I’m starting from scratch. I (think?) that I have a realistic idea of how much school I’ll actually need to go through before I get any type of job in the field, and am going into this process fully expecting that I’ll either need to pursue graduate work or professional school after this degree. 

I’m currently a volunteer docent at my local science center, and I’m planning on taking two or three introductory biochem classes at a community college next fall before applying to universities in the spring. I am also planning to take a lab skills continuing ed class. I have also volunteered at a hospital in the past (as a patient guide/front desk clerk, nothing exciting) and although I’m looking for more volunteering or shadowing opportunities at local healthcare facilities, it’s tough to find those right now because of COVID. 

I’ve made advising appointments with application officers and department heads at a few schools I’m looking at to talk about this stuff, but I’d love to hear from people who went to school for bio. 

My question is: what should I be doing right now to help my chances for admission into a program, and prepare myself for the coursework?

But for starters. I am under the impression that most freshwater eel/unagi have a leptocephalus larval stage. Despite this behavior being observed in fish that are not technically true eels, I have read in a few places that many “eels” have this trait. I am uncertain as to weather or not this is true of all eel including the marine varietals.  Is it accurate to assume that they absorb nutrients through their skin? 

And to date I have yet to find one credible source that shows the successful captive breeding of these/any eels. Does anyone know of it being done, and if not to we have any indicators of the primary issues in doing so? I imagine replicating the salinity shifts for the various marine born species would be a big hurdle but frankly have no idea. 

And finally, sex. I currently keep a ribbon eel (Rhinomuraena quaesita) I’ve had him for about 4/5 years now and he is beginning to exit his hermaphroditic stage and enter his/her adult female stage (assuming I am reading the behavior correctly). Do most/all eels have these stages and shifts in sex? Do we know what exactly motivates them besides age?

Sorry there’s just so much that I want to know and google scholar is only showing me information about preserving a specific species through cryogenic sperm procedures. 

If anyone has any books or maybe cool articles I would be forever in your debt. I really really love eels.

 Psittaciformes (parrots)

I ask this because of two reasons.  One, because the first two orders  are featured in the Speculative Dinosaur Project, a speculative  evolution scenario which detailed on how life might've looked had the  dinosaur empire not fallen 66 million years ago.  This would have  suggested that both clades were in our timeline around long enough to  witness the Chicxulub extinction event, but is this true?  
 

Two, the Wikipedia article on ""Parrot"" states that the order debuted 50  million years ago in the Eocene, yet the molecular evidence suggests  that Psittaciformes is a much older order than that:  
 

&gt;Molecular studies suggest that parrots evolved approximately 59 million years ago (Mya) (range 66–51 Mya) in Gondwana.

biology,"I was listening to the Joe Rogan Podcast (yes I know not an extremely credible source but hear me out). He was talking to Eric Weinstein, a evolutionary biologist. Basically Weinstein's argument was that covid-19 had a high probability of being lab created (or enhanced) because it had two very rare attributes. One being that it was able to cross species and the other was that it was highly transmittable. He said that the combination of these two is so rare that the chances of it being a lab creation are more probable. (Especially because a bio lab is in the neighborhood of where the virus originated in Wuhan. 

I'm no biologist although I think I know more than the average person on evolution. Very basic knowledge nonetheless. I am however a security expert, I know the concept of risk and Murphy's law (everything that can go wrong will go wrong).

I think the argument of the two rare attributes of the virus is not substantial. Statistically, this virus is a once in a 100 year occurrence. People tend to focus as well on things that have impact and neglect data on things that didn't have impact. Meaning, of course this virus has rare attributes otherwise we would have a pandemic very frequently.

biology,"I'm a 23 year old EMT and I recently decided that I want to go back to school to finish off my bachelors. I got an Associates degree in graphic design immediately after finishing high school but decided to pursue EMS instead. I'm considering a BS Degree due to this headstart on my General ED as opposed moving on to paramedic/fire academy as many EMT's do.

Biology interests me due to the relation to my EMT studies. I am just concerned because I feel immensely ill equipped even compared to most recent high school grads. To be quite frank I really just fucked around in high school and did the bare minimum to graduate (algebra 2 and intro to Bio). I've never taken chemistry, pre calc, calculus or even a real bio class for that matter. The extent of my high school academic accomplishments span about what most kids accomplish in their freshman/sophomore year.

With all that said, does this sound like a realistic goal to set out for myself? One of the main reasons I am looking into sciences is because everyone agrees arts are highly competitive, low paying and lacking in job outlook... but is Bio really any better when it comes to competition and job outlook at least?  

Any advice is appreciated. Thanks",EMT looking to pursue a BS in Bio with a serious lack of prerequisite knowledge.. Need realistic advice on outlook.

biology,"Calling it a “predatory avoidance heuristic” is probably not actual scientific nomenclature but allow me to explain. 

I don’t exactly recall where I heard this, but it was something to do with religion and biology. Essentially humans would assume that natural phenomena like lightning and floods, were caused by deities as a result of over-applying a preexisting predatory avoidance mechanism.  

Science tells us that lightning is not the hand of Zeus or Thor, instead a naturally occurring force of nature. That being said other naturally occurring manipulations of nature are things like the wind shaking a bush. However - science doesn’t tell us with any degree of certainty that a bush shaking has to be purely the product of wind applying force to the leaves. Instead there exists a potential probability that it could be an unseen predator stalking an unsuspecting human. 

So as a result, if you are a vulnerable, weak primordial human being, and you notice the rustling of a bush, then it is logically safer to assume that the bush is being manipulated by a life-threatening predator rather than something  innocuous like the wind. If you dismiss the sound and you’re wrong, you likely die. 

So - that particular mechanism is over applied in our psychology to things that science tells us are not the manipulations of living things like earthquakes, volcanoes, or rain. It’s maybe why we call these events acts of God. It could also explain our fear or the unknown, the fact that when we are left with gaps, we fill in the blanks with monsters, deities, or some inexplicable ‘thing’ to inexplicably dread.

It would be cool if this existed, buuuut... does it? Is there a name for it because I would love to know. I can’t seem to find it when I search it up.",Did humans invent religion as the result of a predatory avoidance heuristic?
biology,"First off, I have only a bit more knowledge on conservation biology compared to the common person (senior undergrad biochem major), so these are genuine questions, not trying “stump” people. Also, I just want to say I am 100% an advocate for species and climate conservation and in no way skeptical of human beings having direct and detrimental impacts on the biosphere in general. Anyways...

How do scientists even understand whether or not a species is undergoing a natural extinction, rather than the typically cited case that it’s from human involvement? 
One thought I had for this would be species undergoing rapid and unusually large loss of population over a relatively short amount of time would be a good sign that humans are involved. However, even then how could you determine whether or not a sudden extinction of a species is a direct result of human interaction? I can imagine quick extinction of species has happened many times before modern humans appeared on earth.

This also leads to my next thought: I imagine it can be very easy to make conclusions to any type of species extinction event as that of human involvement. How do scientists know when to rule out human involvement, when we seemingly interact with every aspect of the environment and all life on earth one way or another? Every single time I’ve read the result of an extinction or endangerment of a species being from human involvement, I never even have a second thought or skepticism of these claims, which is bad basic science as EVERYTHING should be questioned. 

Overall, how could we know saving an endangered species is actually bad for the balance of its respective ecology?

Hey guys, I hope you are all doing well. I am 16 years old suffering from Minicore Myopathy, a rare form of Muscular Dystrophy that is non-progressive. I am able to walk independently but I do suffer from dilated cardiomyopathy and lung difficulties.  I have been dealing with these feelings of frustration for a long time and wanted to share.  Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy rightfully gets the attention it deserves because it is the most common and the most severe. But I would also appreciate it if Minicore Myopathy gets some love in the research and gene department. I have an Marfanoid Habitus and I'm still being tested to see which gene mutation I have. All this motivated me to go into this field to hopefully cure this disease for me and many of you guys out there. Through stem cells, gene therapy, robotics via exosuits and nanobots, we should see a drastic change in care for all of us but especially people that have Muscular Dystrophy.  However if any of you, for the time being, can raise awareness for this disease it would be much appreciated, as not enough research and funding go into it. Despite it probably being an easier fix than most muscle disease such as Becker's and Duchenne because the Dystrophin gene is the largest gene.

My lizard men are warm-blooded and need to be able to be as physically active as humans. As far as I understand, one weakness of reptiles is that they cannot swear like mammals and hence have trouble cooling down.

I have an idea to make my lizard men regulate temperature using a sail on their back and head. My idea is that when warm, they'll pump blood into and through the sail to let it cool down, and when cold they'll retract blood from the sail to retain their body heat.

Does this make sense biologically and physically? Is this idea workable?

I like it because it allows for cool body language: A lizard man flushing his sail with blood can indicate excitement or stress (like sweating or blushing in a human), while drying out the sail can indicate calmness or even fear (like shivering).

At the AP's peak, the sodium channels will be inactivated, until it goes back down to the resting potential. What's the difference between an inactivated channel and a closed channel? Is it that a closed channel has the possibility of opening back up, while an inactive channel can't open back up until it goes back to the resting voltage and becomes closed?

biology,"I’ve seen osmosis defined in several different ways in different textbooks and sources. A google search for the term returns the answer “a process by which molecules of a solvent tend to pass through a semipermeable membrane from a less concentrated solution into a more concentrated one, thus equalizing the concentrations on each side of the membrane.” 

I’ve seen several other sources say similar things about water moving from low to high solute concentration, but I noticed a problem with this definition in a plant physiology textbook. 

The book mentioned that osmosis was driven both by a concentration gradient and a pressure gradient (due to the pressure aspect of water potential). So it would seem more correct to mention water potential in the definition: “diffusion of water from a place of high water potential to low water potential across a semipermeable membrane.”

But then other sources bring up additional definitions, saying that water moves from high to low water concentration, but this doesn’t sit right with me either.  This is because books like Campbell biology take caution to mention that water moves from high FREE water concentration to lower free water concentration, explaining that solutes bind the number of water molecules that are free to cross the membrane. They define it as “the diffusion of free water across a selectively permeable membrane,”

Then we get into the word diffusion. If I’m trying to explain osmosis to someone simply without having to explain a precise definition of diffusion, would it be correct to say that it is just the “movement of water across a semipermeable membrane?” And then just mention it happens without input of energy? This is what the aforementioned plant physiology textbook does, and I think this is the easiest to understand.",What is the most precise definition of Osmosis?

biology,"If humans are made for running why can it so easily result in major injury.

The human foot seems incredibly fragile, runners get injuries like no other sport I have ever seen. 

The arch of the foot is not supported by any bones. If one would run without shoes through a forest and step on a branch, it would easily penetrate the arch of the foot, below the skin are all the ligaments completely exposed. 

Animals that are good at running, quadrupeds, do not have any of those issues, the arch of the foot is raise high above the ground, the ligaments are never close the ground. The paws that do hit the ground are made up of a close grouping of bones and heavy padding.

Are humans really meant to run, or are they meant to walk and only run to get away from danger.",Are humans really made for running? Is it even healthy?
biology,"Dunno if I should post this here, but I've seen something similar so I'm going to assume it's fine.

Okay so here's the question + the story. My half-brother (I have no idea if this is relevant, I don't think it is, but there's no harm in clarifying) looks extremely different from me, which you might be thinking is because we're half siblings, but it's not. We share the same mother, she's half German and half Lebanese, and we both take after her almost entirely rather than our fathers. Here's the thing, my brother takes mostly after the Lebanese side, darker olive skin, thick almost black hair, brown eyes etc. Although he is taller, unlike our grandfather. While I take more after the German side, dark brown hair, but not thick (it may be a little thicker than average I'm not sure) I'm taller than average in my country and my family (minus my German relatives, pretty similar height), and a few other things. I take a lot after our grandmother. My question is why do we look like opposite sides of our mother's ethnicity? My mom also looks more like her father (Lebanese). 

To clarify a bunch of things now. When I talk about looking more German, it's in reference to how my German relatives look and based off of their features, not any average or typical feature. Also I'm certain my brother and I look almost nothing like our fathers because my father is blond, he has brown eyes, and he's quite short, it's the same with most of my family on my dad's side. He's French as well, unsure if that matters. Also, I have hazel eyes which I'm not sure where I got, and I'm assuming the German but I really don't know. For my brother's father, I'm pretty sure he's Irish and/or English and not much else, he also I think has black hair, it could be brown (he's been mostly bald the entire time I've known him, he's mostly grey now, and with old pictures it's hard to tell), but definitely nowhere near thick and he's quite pale and I think has blue or grey eyes. I'm unsure about other family but I think it's generally the same on most of his dad's side. Also neither of us look exactly like the one side, it's just that's what we mostly look like. So for example while I do have a lot of the German features, I look so much like my mom when she was younger, but it's mostly in the face shape rather than anything and my skin has somewhat of a greener undertone, almost like olive, but I'm very pale. Also my full brother has the same basic features as me, so the dark hair and height and stuff but he has my mom's brown eyes and his facial features are more like my dad's. His hair also is a different shade of brown, mine is more red. I'm assuming since my grandma had very red-brown hair. I also have a half sister who shares the same dad as me, but we look nothing alike and she takes after both her father and her mother for sure. She does look like me when I was younger, but as she gets older the similarities disappear so there's that. 

I don't know if I missed on clearing anything up so it's not confusing, and I don't know if I used any sort of correct terminology, but oh well, I'm sure it's at least legible. I've always thought ethnicity was perfectly split, so I would be 25% Lebanese, 25% German, and 50% French, but now I'm not so sure so that's why I'm asking. Also it'd be super cool to learn about this since I'm seriously considering having a career in the field of biology.

I don't need a very detailed explanation (it would be cool, but it's not necessary), just enough to help me understand the way it works. I've seen a lot of things on the explanation but the ones I've seen have mostly been inheriting different genes from different parents. I just need to know why the visual features are so different for 2 kids sharing one parent's DNA. I may have put in too much information, but I didn't want any confusion and I didn't know what info was needed. I understand that this subject is complicated and probably difficult to explain, but I'd appreciate it.

biology,"There are some supplements and vitamins which are fat soluble and don't mix well with water. Most of them are sold in the form of a time-release capsule. Check out this video showing how a capsule is absorbed in the stomach:

https://youtu.be/b3J7hdXUhsY

As per the video, it takes around 45 minutes for the shell of a capsule to dissolve in stomach. Which means that the contents of the capsule are not released in the stomach in the first 45 minutes. 

We are often advised to take fat soluble supplements with something like curd or oil, or to just to take it after meals. But as shown in this video, the capsule will not interact with the curd/oil in the first 45 minutes. And once it's released, by that time perhaps the fatty substance we consumed it with would have been dissolved by the stomach and hence unable to bind with the medicine? 

So my question is, is it a good strategy to consume the fatty substance around 45 minutes after consuming the capsule, so that it can bind with it? Or that fatty substance will still be present in the stomach at that time to bind with the supplement? 

Ofcourse, we could open up the capsule and mix it with a fatty substance before consuming. But given that most supplement and vitamins aren't exactly a tasty treat, I would prefer to swallow them instead.",Best way to take fat soluble supplements?

 I say partenogenesis is one thing and the other two are other things, that we could group together in something like ""copulation dependent asexual reproduction"".

 PARTENO= virgin. But partenogenesis can involve copulation? Every definition of partenogenesis I can find supports my theory. Including the one in Origin of the Species: ""Partenogenesis is the production of living organisms from UNIMPREGNATED eggs or seeds"".

biology,"Hi all,

as the title states, I'm a bit conflicted about my career options. As of right now, I'm working on my BSc thesis and I expect to graduate this summer, with a BSc in biology. I was planning on continuing with a MSc in the field of ethology/animal behaviour, maybe with some extra courses in neuroethology, however, I'm now doubting that decision.

I've always had broad interests, so picking a BSc major was already difficult. I was very interested in medicine (I thought about becoming a surgeon), (wildlife) veterinary medicine and wildlife biology. I ended up choosing for the latter, because the idea of doing fieldwork and discovering new things was absolutely thrilling.

But after having looked at career options for ethologists/wildlife biologists, and considering my BSc research project, I'm afraid I made the wrong call. Maybe my research project gave me the wrong idea (due to the pandemic messing everything up and having to work from home), but it seems like there's a big chance of ending up in an office. I choose this major with the goal of being able to do research ""out in the field"", getting down and dirty. I don't want to end up inside looking at a screen 99% of the time. I know analysis and writing is a big part of research, and I don't mind that at all! 

Besides, the ""what-if' questions keep nagging me. What if I had chosen to study veterinary medicine instead? I like doing research, but I don't want to become a professor (I don't want to teach). Being a wildlife veterinarian sounds like a dream job, but I would miss the research. If only I could combine the two...

biology,"Hi, 

I posted this in r/chemistry and r/DIYBeauty, but I think this is where it belongs

So basically, I am trying to formulate a skincare treatment to restore beneficial bacteria to my skin microbiome, in particular, I want to encourage s. epidermidis to ferment glycerol into acids that can kill off P. acnes. Yes, I have pretty persistent acne. I'm interested in this self-sustaining/homeostatic concept of bacteria on our skin THAT IS IN BALANCE with other bacteria, and can KEEP the balance. 

So I included loads of prebiotics, like inulin, oligosaccharides, sucrose, some plant sugars, and yeast proteins in the formulation. And of course, some bioferments. This is where I am worried (about the shelf-life, and \*\*preservative choice\*\*). 

My formulation is mainly comprised of bioferments of ingredients like rice, and it contains several strands of lactobacillus and other probiotics. Basically the formulation is chock-full of active fermented microbes, but I need to preserve the thing. Some preservations, like phenoxyethanol, is an irritant. 

I've decided to go with Silver citrate + citric acid, as well as an anti-microbial lactobacillus strand. I've included a third, gentler preservative — gluconolactone. My question is, will these preservatives kill the beneficial probiotic strands/microbes in my product? They are broad-spectrum after all. 

Please keep reading this next bit!

My formulation is currently this:

Deionised water, MC-Glucan (10%), Dimethyl Isosorbide (8%), Lactococcus Ferment Lysate (8%), Makgealli Extract (7%), Bacillus/Soybean Ferment Extract (7%), Hydrolized Yeast Protein (7%), Amber Extract (7%), Ophiopogon Japonicus root extract (7%), Inulin (6%), Leucidal Liquid (4%), \[water, milk proteins, bilfida ferment lysate\] (4%), \[alpha-glucan oligosaccharides, P.S. root juice, maltodextrin, lactobacillus\] (4%), Gluconolactone (3%), Bio Chelate \[water, saccharomyces zinc, saccharomyces copper, saccharomyces magnesium, saccharomyces Magnesium, saccharomyces Iron, saccharomyces Silicon\] (2%), Hydrolyzed hemp protein (2%), Silverion \[silver citrate, citric acid\] (0.15%)

Any glaring mistakes? Luckily this is a water-based, oil-free project, so I didn't have to add emulsifiers. Any stabilizers necessary? I estimate the final pH (after adjusting, of course) to be 5.8.

I'm worried about the amount of microorganisms in this, and the preservatives used. Will they kill all the beneficial microbes? Anyone know of a preservative/preservative system that is broad-spectrum, but is gentle and does not attack certain strains of commensialistic/beneficial bacteria?

I realize that was a kind of snoozy read, but if you have any suggestions/knowledge about cosmetic chemistry and bacteria, PLEASE reply!

An organism's phenotype results from two basic factors: the expression of an organism's genetic code and the influence of environmental factors""

biology,"Hi All - as the title says, I want to learn more about the energy allocation decisions taken by plants, and am struggling to find \*the definitive\* book. 

How do plants decide whether to direct 100% of the energy they generate to growth, or possibly store some for harder times? How do they know whether it's in their best interest to promote root vs. stem vs. leaf growth? Is reproduction a sign that they think their life is coming to an end? Are their growth aspirations limited after a certain period, after which their energy allocation decisions naturally change? If not, then I'd imagine that in the ideal environment, a plant would just keep on growing forever..? 

So far I've come across the fields of 'Biomass Partitioning' and 'Plant Strategies', but would love a general book that tackles all of these questions, and ideally does so from the perspective from lots of different plants. 

Finally, I found this sentence from the Biomass Partitioning wiki page especially interesting: 'By responding to environmental stimuli and partitioning biomass accordingly, plants are better able to take in resources from their environmental and maximize growth'. Is maximising growth an innate, hard-coded priority for all plants? Are some plants more 'hungry' for growth, and are other more indifferent, or are they all desperate to grow as much as possible? If there is variation, what is the factor that drives the underlying level of desire for growth? 

Any assistance and/ or reading materials would be greatly appreciated!",Looking for book recommendations re. how plants decide to allocate energy for growth / reproduction / storage etc.

biology,"Hi everyone,

I am doing an undergraduate research project that involves being able to do blaZ gene typing for different strain types of Staphylococcus aureus bacteria; for reference, here are some of the papers on this topic:

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3421557/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3421557/) 

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC188454/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC188454/) 

 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC106017/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC106017/) 

Right now, I need to be able to align blaZ gene sequences in plasmids (or chromosome, when looking at type B blaZ genes) of different bacterial strains to the four blaZ gene types (A, B, C, and D) reference strains as mentioned in the first paper. The first paper provides the following strains as ""reference strains"":  type A, PC1; type B, 22260; type C, RN98; and type D, FAR19. However, I can only find the nucleotide sequence for PC1 and the partial sequence for 22260 on Genbank; when I search for RN98 or FAR19, no relevant results come up. Even though these gene type sequences should only be distinguishable by several SNPs, it's important that I have references for all four for the most accurate strain typing. 

In the last paper, I noticed they provide some of the differences between all four blaZ gene type nucleotide sequences, but not in a ""from start to finish"" order (i.e. the numbering above the nucleotides is not sequential and the sequence comparison length overall is less than 846, which is the length of the PC1 coding regions).

I then measured the number of bubbles produced in these test tubes for each solution in cm. The answers were as followed: controlled - 0.9cm, acidic - 0.5cm and basic 0.1cm. I'm unsure how these results are even possible when upon research catalyse only work between 7-11pH and I had already predicted that the best outcome would be from the basic solution as H2O2 is a weak acid and NaOH is a strong base, producing a near-neutral solution.

""It is instructive to consider how this physical mechanism plays out in a clear and accessible case, such as that of the mechanically agitated self-replicating amyloid fibres studied by Carnall and colleague. The authors synthesized building blocks for dithiol macrocycles ligated to peptide tails. By vigorously shaking these components over the course of days, they were able to observe the self-catalysed growth of particular fibrillar species made of stacked macrocycles. In this case, the basic mechanism proposed was that the slower linear growth of fibrils was accelerated through mechanical perturbation, which increased the number of exposed end-points by breaking fibrils. **Since longer fibrils are more ‘competent’ to absorb work and snap, but shorter ones polymerize in less time**, a balance was struck that favoured the exponential growth of fibres of finite length. This may explain why it was found that shaking enabled hexamer growth to compete with the **normally faster heptamer growth**, since **heptamers were less competent to snap under shear**. ""

He then writes this:

""One recent study has used *in vitro* evolution to optimize the growth rate of a self-replicating RNA molecule whose formation is accompanied by a single backbone ligation reaction and the leaving of a single pyrophosphate group. It is reasonable to assume that the reverse of this reaction, in which the highly negatively charged pyrophosphate would have to attack the phosphate backbone of the nu- cleic acid, would proceed more slowly than a simple hydrolysis by water. **The rate of such hydrolysis has been measured by carrying out a linear fit to the early-time (20 day) exponential kinetics of spontaneous degradation for the RNAase A substrate UpA, and the half-life measured is on the order of 4 years.10 Thus, with a doubling time of 1 h for the self-replicator, we can estimate for this system that ln\[g/δ\] ≥ ln\[(4 years)/(1 h)\] ""**

In the bolded bit, why has he taken g = 4 years, and δ = 1 hour? If the doubling time of the self-replicator is 1 hour, then shouldn't g = 1 hour?

biology,"Hello! I am an MS Microbiology student from Asia. Due to COVID and forced quarantine measures, the semester was cut early. Online classes were also suspended in consideration of those who don't have internet access. For these reasons, my university has decided to change the grading scheme from numerical-based to a ""Pass/Fail"" system. We can opt to get a ""pass remark with adjectival description"" to qualify the ""pass"" remark (basically, numerical ranges are given a distinct adjectival description; ie. 4.0 to 3.5 = excellent). We can also opt for a numerical grade but these are all upon the discretion of the professors. 

&amp;#x200B;

My question is: **how do you think this grading scheme will affect my PhD applications in the future?** I will probably apply in PhD programs abroad 2 years from now. Yes, conditions might be better by then but the change of grading scheme will still be reflected in my transcripts. I also know that other factors are taken into consideration like publications, conferences, extra-curricular, work experience, etc. So let us brush those aside for now and surmise how a ""pass"" remark will be viewed by universities.  

&amp;#x200B;

Thank you! I really hope you can help me with this because I am really anxious. I was an average undergrad student. I promised myself that MS will be my redemption. So far, it has been good (I had a GPA of 3.92 last semester). COVID ruined everything - scheduled conferences, poster presentations, possible publishing opportunities, internships, etc...

My experience.. 
I’m a biomedical Science student so I never dissected anything. I was required to look and feel. Along with a theory test, we had to do a physical, but there was no dissection.

Towards the end I enjoyed it more than I did at the start. It took me a while. I went in pretty depressed, and it made me think.... we either end up below the ground or like this.. what’s the point!? It made my depression much worse. However I got better, and I started enjoying it more.

For me, the toughest part was the flesh. Specifically the muscles. It was rough. My favourite part was the first time seeing the spinal cord. Just like a sting ray tail. Amazing! I also love the CV system so seeing the heart was great... the blood vessels, not so much. But for sure, the muscles were my least fav. They were also the thing I had to spend the most time on because we had to name every one- deep, superficial and medial- so we had to view them a lot... I hated it.

Also, I will never, ever , forget the smell. I know it’s all the preservative, but it’s disgusting. Everytime I have to use that squirt disinfectant soap, it puts me right back in that lab. Eh.

I am in a biomedicine degree so I’m not in medical school to be a doctor. I just have a very big interest in medical science. I’ll never have to cut through a body, so I’m lucky and didn’t have to dissect or cut any of the cadavers.. Theory is my main thing and I don’t have to do the physical as much. And even though I enjoyed the lab at the end, three full semester of it was enough for me and I don’t think I will ever steps foot in one again.. I hope !

biology,"The Indian Grey Wolf, *Canis lupus pallipes* went extinct in Bangladesh back in the 1950s. The wolves entered the Endangered list in neighboring India in the 1970s, so the possibility of the few remaining Indian Greys crossing int boundaries just to move back to hostile territories where they went extinct decades ago- in search of a home that no longer exists seem hiiighly unlikely, right? FYI, the Black buck, *Antilope cervicapra*, the fav prey of these wolves also went extinct in Bangladesh during early 20th century.  

But a wildlife photographer rediscovered a lone *Canis lupus pallipes* in the Bangladesh portion of the Sundarbans, the mangrove forest on the GBM delta, in 2017. But in June, 2019, villagers in the Sundarbans killed an Indian Grey. Local experts don't think it was the same lone wolf seen in 2017. There's been speculations among the natives that 3-4 clans of wolves live in the Mangroves. So how can a handful of *Canis lupus pallipes* even survive in the salt water Mangroves, then?

Btw wildlife conservation is extremely difficult around here, as the need to feed and house the massive native population shrinks wildlife habitats and keep fuelling human-predator conflicts. There's very little tropical deciduous forests left in the country, where the wolves once reigned. I'm curious about the harmful changes/consequences due to the extinction of keystone predators in the country's vulnerable ecosystems, but there seems to be little to no hq literature on the issue.

* **Introduction:** 

The agents of human infectious disease [bacteria](https://www.biologyseba.com/2020/04/structure-of-bacterial-cells.html)

 belong to five major groups of organisms ,and these are **fungi, bacteria, protozoa, helminths,and viruses.**

Bacteria is present in the prokaryote kingdom.

Depending upon the shape, bacteria are classified into three basic groups, these are cocci, bacilli, spirochetes.

The size of bacteria varies from about 0.2 to 5 μm.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/m0gotfqfpl551.jpg?width=1920&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9a47dd9a0d17cc6653114c84a1f85d9f83a24b9f

The size of the smallest **bacteria** (Mycoplasma) and the largest viruses (poxviruses) are almost same.The longest **bacteria** rods are the size of some yeasts and human RBC.

* **Structure of bacteria:**

## Cell wall of the bacteria: 

## This the outermost component which is present in all the bacteria (except Mycoplasma species).

The significance of this complex bacterial cell wall are to protect the protoblasts from external noxae, which then help to withstand and to maintain the osmotic pressure gradient between the cell interior and the extracellular environment, to give the cell it's outer form and to facilitate communication with its surrounding.

Some bacteria have surface features external to the cell wall, such as **capsule**, **flagella and pili.**

The cell wall is located external to the cytoplasmic membrane and is made up of **peptidoglycan**.

# Cytoplasmic membrane:

The cytoplasmic membrane is present just inside the peptidoglycan layer of the cell wall.It is composed of phospholipid bilayer similar in microscopic appearance to that in eukaryotic cells.

## Cytoplasm of bacteria:

When observed through the electron microscope it is seen that the cytoplasm of the bacteria has two distinct areas , these are,

1. An **amorphous matrix**, in which ribosomes, nutrient granules, metabolites and plasmids are present.
2. An **inner, nucleoid region** which is composed of DNA.

## Ribosomes:

The ribosomes of the **bacteria** are the place, where protein synthesis takes place, like the eukaryotic cells. But the chemical composition and the size of the **bacterial** are different from that of eukaryotic ribosomes.

The size of bacterial ribosomes is 70S , and contains 50S and 30S subunits, but the size of the eukaryotic ribosomes are 80S , and it contains 60S and 40S subunits.

## Granules:

## Nucleoid:

This is the area of the cytoplasm in the bacteria in which DNA is located.The DNA which is present in the prokaryotes ,are circular molecule,and which has a molecular weight of about 2 × 10\^9 and also contains about 2000 genes.There is resemblance to the eukaryotic nucleus becuse in the nucleoid nuclear membrane, nucleolus ,mitotic spindle, histone are not present.

There is no introns present in the **bacterial** DNA.

## Plasmids:

Plasmids are extra chromosomal, double-stranded , circular DNA molecules that are capable of replicating independently of the bacterial chromosome.Although plasmids are usually extra chromosomal, they can be integrated into the bacterial chromosome.In both gram positive and gram negative bacteria plasmids occur, and several different types of plasmid can exist in one cell these are 

1.Transmissible plasmids

2. Neurotransmissible plasmids.

## Transposons:

Transposons are prices of DNA , that move fastly from one site to another either within or between the DNAs of **bacteria**, plasmids and bacteriophages.They are nicknamed as ''jumping genes'' because of their unusual ability to move.Transposons can code for drug resistance enzymes, toxins or a variety of metabolic enzymes and can either cause mutations in the gene into which they insert or alert the expression of nearby genes.There is four identifiable domains present in the transposons

* **Structure out side the cell wall:**

## Capsule:

It is a gelatinous layer present surrounding the entire **bacterium**.The capsule is composed of polysaccharide (except in the anthrax bacillus).The capsule is important because of it's four important role

 1.It is determinant of virulence of many **bacteria** since it limits the ability of phagocytes to engulf the bacteria.

 2.By using antiserum against the capsular polysaccharides , specific identification of an organisms can be made.

  3.In certain vaccines capsular polysaccharides are used as antigens , because of their role in eliciting protective antibodies.

   4.In the adherence of **bacteria** to the human tissues, capsule has an important role, which is an important primary step in causing infections.

## Flagella:

Flagella are long, whip-like appendages that help in the movement of **bacteria** toward nutrient and other attractants,a process which is known as chemotaxis.The long filament, which acts as a propeller,is composed of many subunits of a single protein,flagellin.

Flagellated **bacteria** have a characteristic number and location of flagella.

Flagella are medially important for two reasons

 1.Some species of motile **bacteria** are common causes of urinary tract infections.

 2.Some species of **bacteria** are identified in the clinical laboratory by the use of specific antibodies against flagellar proteins.

## Pili:

Pili are hair like filaments that extend from the cell surface.They are shorter and straighter than flagella,and are made up of pilin.

Pili have two main role:

  1.They regulate the attachment of bacteria with the specific receptor present on the human cell surface.

  2.A specialized kind of pilus,the sex pilus, forms the attachment between the male and the female **bacteria** during conjugation.

## Glycocalyx(Slime layer) of bacteria:

 It is a polysaccharide coating that is secreted by many **bacteria**. The glycocalyx is an important component of biofilms.

The glycocalyx mediates adherence of certain **bacteria**.

## Bacterial spores: 

## These highly resistance structures are formed in response to adverse conditions by two genera of medially important gram positive rods: the genus Bacillus and the genus Clostridium.",Structure of bacteria

biology," Imagine you are a sentient sponge. A unique and amazing organism full of mystery and evolutionary wonder. Curious humans harvest you from the ocean. Some poke at you and eventually use complex biological research methods to figure you out. They declare you a primitive animal. 

“That’s rude” you say, “I’m not primitive! I’m a god damn modern masterpiece.”

The humans scoff. “You’ve barely reached multicellularity and have little to no specialization. Of course you are primitive.”, “You don’t even have a nervous system, or muscles, or adaptive immunity, or symmetry!”

“You don’t even know me! You’re only pointing out what I don’t have.”

What the humans didn’t know is that the sponge held many interesting and new developments since they diverged from the last common ancestor. New features unique to the spongy kingdom. Funny things those humans. They always look for primitive versions of themselves that they ignore unique developments in modern life. Plotting a path along the tree of life that perfectly fits human evolution. 

How did our brain evolve? Let us look at the descending path of nervous systems from ape to mammals, reptiles, amphibians, fish, lamprey, amphioxus, etc. While these guys may hold remnants of the primitive brain, it is easy to forget that these are all modern organisms. They may have evolved new features that we ignore because we are looking for genes and physiology homologous to humans. 

Keep in mind: Biologists use MODEL organisms. Not the original ancestor. The further down the tree of life we go, the more chance there are new and unique features. But if we are only looking for homology, we will overlook those features. This the idea of hidden biology. Created usually by a bilaterian, vertebrate, or human centric view of biological research.

biology,"Hey r/biology

I am a rising 4th year student in computer science and mathematics, who is aspiring to become a computer scientist and even though I have a scientific curiosity that need to be fed independently and understand the importance of basic research with no applications in mind and its influence on modern science and technology, I have been having some strong feelings and finding it a little hard to justify doing research that most likely won't have an impact on people's lives (in a good way, doing algorithms research for Facebook or increasing the performance of ML systems that are quite far removed from being applied in practice doesn't count for example)

After thinking about it for a while I realized how important it is for me to not only pursue my scientific curiosities but also have an impact on people's lives and come to realize that biology provides what is quite possibly one of the finest balances between these two, where I find myself quite interested whenever I read about new advances in biology, and there is no question that research in many areas of biology has quite possibly the greatest rate of direct implications on people's lives among all the sciences. I am aware that with all research comes the risk that you produce nothing of value, but the premise of a lot of the research in biology seems to me worth the risk . So my questions are:

1. Is my view of biology research naive? I understand that not all biology research has direct implications and there is a lot of research that is purely basic research, but I imagine that its easier for biology students to participate in research with high potential of making an impact on people's lives, no?
2. How impactful do you think your research is, and briefly what is it on?
3. How hard would it be for a computer science and math student having taken no course in biology (but willing to spend whatever time to learn, I am a quick self-learner) to do research in biology (by going to grad school in biology or other departments that will allow me to do biology research). Note that  I am aware of computational biology, but having gone over the problems the field deals with briefly it doesn't seem to catch my attention (remember I am trying to balance my scientific curiosity with impact, otherwise I would have went to med school :p) What about fields that are further away from CS and math like molecular biology, I have heard of people making such switches like Venki Ramakrishnan and Francis Crick (Physics to Structural biology) however physics to structural biology is much closer of a switch than CS and math to any non-comp bio field, also these were exceptional people..
4. How do you see advances in computer science affecting your field, biology in general, and medicine (I know this is not the best sub to ask about medicine, but while we are at it..)?

All in all I am finding it extremely hard to justify not working on scientific questions relating to elevating the human condition.

Any input would be appreciated.

I don’t remember the exact numbers but the streptomycin disc that was coated in caffeine solution had a larger inhibitory zone that the streptomycin on its own and the control. The data did show statistical significance (X^2 &gt; 0.05),

I was never really able to find supporting research, but I have two theories;

1. The caffeine made the environment basic enough to affect the E. coli’s cellular processes; or

2. The caffeine increased the uptake of streptomycin into the bacteria.

I am currently doing an internship at a marine research lab as a chemist and have been tasked to find a suitable alternative to stain the macrozoobenthos samples with.

I was wondering if anyone could help me find out how this colour comes to be or at least push me in the right direction of finding out.

I made a post earlier today if anyone would be up for a subreddit for the science behind cryptids. Basically a problem with cryptids is that discussions are often clouded by people which make exaggerate or paranormal claims regarding cryptids which works against any discussion from a scientific point of view about sighted cryptids. Are they a hoax, a known animal which is misidentified as an extinct animal, or are there perhaps some animals which we haven't discovered yet which are only sighted as cryptids? That is what I created this place for, paranormal claims and creationism are explicitly not allowed, to avoid any claims of ""aliens"" or ""interdimensional beings"" which you see in some other cryptid subs. This cryptid sub tries to go off from a scientific basis, in which people can look at the claims in the sightings, the habitat and so on and compare it with the extinct species to see if there is any scientific background for the claims being made.

There are some former cryptids which turned out to exist, so it would be very interesting if some people interested in biology would be interested to participate in discussions on cryptids to see what the science is behind these claims.

I don't believe in nonsense like creationism and aliens (*not how aliens are presented in these kind of theories or bigfoot as an ""interdimensional being"", any aliens out there are probably too far away from us*). What I would be interested in would be if we had a subreddit with serious discussion on the science behind cryptids, but not being merely a debunking sub for the mere purpose of debunking in itself, but a sub to debunk those theories for cryptids which are obviously wrong, but also look at which cryptids might in fact have some scientific background to be remotely possible.

My issue basically is, cryptozoology seems to be clouded by the wacky idiots which try to tie their creationist agenda or speculative, unverifiable and unfalsifiable paranormal claims. This fogs the part of cryptids and cryptozoology which are actually concerned with genuinely possible animals to still exist within the realm of science. An example is the giant octopus or the kraken which is within the scientific possibilities.

Are there any more people interested in this which would like to moderate such a subreddit in which we look at the science behind unidentified animal (witness accounts) and cryptids? This would mean that for example a discussion on bigfoot, the pros and cons for the existence is possible, but that any claims of bigfoot being an interdimensional being would not be allowed, because that is an unfalsifiable and paranormal claim which is not fitting with any of our biological knowledge of how species work. Another example would be the discussion of possible surviving non-avian dinosaurs. Discussion about that would be possible, but a non-avian dinosaur which would have survived would just like a coelacanth not disprove evolution and therefore creationist propaganda would have to be removed.

The biggest concern which I would have for a sub like this would be, despite how highly interesting it would be for the scientific aspect, how hard it would be to moderate with people trying to tie in their creationism.",Would there be any interest for a subreddit for the science behind cryptids and unidentified animals?

biology,"So I was reading [this article](https://aeon.co/essays/the-selfish-gene-is-a-great-meme-too-bad-it-s-so-wrong) and it introduced me to the concept of genetic assimilation. They define it like this

&gt; First, an organism adapts to a changing environment by altering its gene expression to change its phenotype — its form or behaviour. Second, a gene emerges that locks in that phenotypic change. Finally, the gene spreads through the population.

Now I have no problem with the first step. An organism's gene expression is altered through forced behavioral change that results in a phenotype change. But how does the new emergent gene have anything to do with the prior genotypic alteration, other than it serves a similar purpose? Wouldn't that emergent gene be selected for regardless of epigenetic(if that's the correct term) changes to the phenotype, simply because of the initial change in environment leading to increased fitness for that gene? 

Or is it all about sexual selection, where the emergent gene is selected for breeding as a result of the shared epigenetic behavior. That doesn't really make sense to me.",How is genetic assimilation different from normal natural selection due to a changing environment?

It is generally agreed that there are about 20000 protein-coding sequences in the human genome (although this number is subject to update and not a final number by a long shot).

I wonder what is the level/nature of duplication in the data bank. Of course there are functional mutations of the same protein such that slightly different sequences may have been uploaded by different uploaders. But I would like to treat them as the same protein and see what total count I get as a result.

I'm also wondering how the deposit process works. If I deposit a protein sequence, does RCSB do any double check or template-matching search to make sure it's not a duplicate or 99% similar to an existing protein? Or is it free for all?

Has anyone attempted to download the whole data bank, process the sequences to eliminate functional duplicates?

My best guess is that after the duplicates are eliminated, we may still not have all the proteins of single human (i.e., the total number might drop below 20000?)

A side question: If I want to find the sequences of all proteins in a single human genome, we can use the publically available human genomes, but then has anyone done the transcription+translation and counted the number of proteins (of course it's not an easy task, with the splicing, post-translations modifications and what not, but still. Feel free to comment. Thanks).

**edit**: I guess, the genome-to-proteome (all in silico) is more complicated than it initially appeared to me. Do we have comprehensive knowledge of which mRNA are non-translating, so the rest translate into proteins. Does de novo protein folding need to be carried out for obscure proteins because no experimental data is available?

biology,"I've recently been working on a bioinformatics project, and part of my job is to retrieve information about specific proteins and the genes that encode them (these proteins are from two different species of bacteria). I'm using SnapGene to view GenBank files that contain genome sequences for each of these bacterial species, and I've noticed that directionality has been specified for each gene (i.e. forward/reverse) to indicate the strand on which the gene is found in the genome.

I understand that, by convention, the ""forward strand"" appears as 5'-&gt;3' (with 5' on the left and 3' on the right) and the ""reverse strand"" appears as 3'-&gt;5' (with 3' on the left and 5' on the right) in a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule. However, I don't understand how this notation is kept consistent across different databases and different species. **What prevents either strand from being viewed as the ""forward"" strand by different people?** (i.e. in the same way that either strand can be the ""coding"" or ""template"" strand, depending on the strand being transcribed).

Since each complementary, antiparallel strand in a dsDNA molecule technically runs from 5'-&gt;3' (especially when you can just change the physical orientation of the molecule so that either strand has its 5' end is on the ""left""), **what criteria is used to permanently designate one strand, but** **not the other, as ""forward""?**

I've been searching through university notes, multiple biochemistry/cell biology/genetics textbooks and academic literature, and I haven't found a satisfying answer--I would be incredibly grateful towards those who can provide clarification for me on this topic!

NOTES:

* I've seen some people on other online forums claim that the ""forward"" strand has its 5' end at the end of the short arm in a Eukaryotic chromosome, but \[A\] I don't believe this applies to bacteria and \[B\] I don't know enough about the orientation of DNA in chromosomes to verify this.
* Furthermore, I've seen others claim that the assignment of ""forward/reverse"" is arbitrary. I currently don't think this is true, based on my understanding of[ Illumina's sequencing by synthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCd6B5HRaZ8) procedure, which depends on being able to consistently differentiate between DNA fragments with different directionalities.
* I've also seen people claim that, for bacteria, directionality comes from the direction of replication, but this doesn't make sense to me based on my understanding of the[ bi-directional nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmWuju1S9_E) of bacterial replication.","If both strands of DNA in a double-stranded molecule begin at their 5' end and terminate at their 3' end, why is only one strand designated as the ""forward"" strand?

I'm currently studying bachelor's biology in Europe, and I have a question for you.

In biology the salaries are pretty low and I want to make or be able to make some nice money after university.

And I like biology altough I probably don't want to make researches in lab or sth like that. Don't get me wrong I like working in lab, just don't want my whole life be stuck at lab.

So my question is, should I pair my future biology degree with some business degree or with informatics? Both interest me and doing bioinformatics/data science seems much more enjoyable to me than biology and research work in lab. 

But with the business degree the possibilities seems to be much wider, I mean I could do almost anything, right?

biology,"Can someone explain the difference.

As I understand it, phenotypic plasticity = the ability for environmental factors to alter the expression of a gene during an organisms development, therefore altering ontogeny and creating different phenotypes under different conditions. The phenotype is life long but not heritable, however the plastic gene and therefore response to environment is heritable. Species with high plasticity can therefore tolerate wider ranges of environmental factors and thus it can help adaptation occur in other genes, by allowing existence of the species outside of the range it would be constrained to without the plastic gene.

&amp;#x200B;

Now what she said about epigenetics confused me a little: all she said was that it provides a mechanism for phenotypic plasticity. So to me epigenetics is the mechanism that alters expression, i,e high heat in the environment during development, stimulates hormone production which stimulates a response within a cell by, for example: changing mrna, trna or even protein structure / expression leading to a different developmental path and therefore lasting structure within an organism.

But then she said it causes lasting and heritable change. I.e a plant expressing epigenetic tolerance for higher heat will have offspring with this tolerance, even if they are not in a high heat environment, (this obviously contradicts phenotypic plasticity). This also means it must cause changes in DNA somehow that are present germ cells.

So my questions are:

1. How is epigenetic change passed to gametes.
2. Does epigenetics govern phenotypic plasticity i.e non heritable change due to environment as well as heritable change, and if so does it just depend on where the mechanism causes changes in protein expression, i,e at the DNA level or after translation has occurred?
3. Is epigenetic change ever reversible, either in the organism it originated in, or between generations, if so how?",Epigenetics vs phenotypic plasticity

biology," I was provided the following statements.  How accurate are these?

&gt; In the book (2016) -“Developmental Approach to Human Evolution”, by professor Julia Boghner (Department of Anatomy and cell Biology, University of Sakatchewan) and professor Campbell Rolian ( Department of Comperative Biology and Experimental Medicine, University of Calgary), they stated that-

&gt; The signalling for bone formation is present earlier then the signalling for muscle formation. Cartilage (pre-bone) is present , before the muscle formation.

&gt; Limb muscle progenitor cell don't have any information about position. The first tissue cell that subsequently condensed to form bone provides positional information for soft tissue formation.

&gt; Page 122–123.

&gt; “After initial outgrowth stages are completed, limb buds and segments continue to elongate and morphological features such as hand/foot plates, and joints of the proximal and distal limbs (e.g., elbow, wrist, knee, and ankle) become identifiable. During this time, cells in respective stylopod, zeugopod, and autopod compartments coalesce to form separate pre‐chondrogenic mesenchymal condensations. These condensations are shaped via joint development, chondrogenesis, and osteogenesis to produce the many separate skeletal elements of the limb, although how this occurs is only poorly understood. At the same time, muscle and tendon cells begin to migrate into compartments of the limb to form its muscles.”

&gt; So, seems pre-bone formation occur at first. Then muscle progenitor cell migrates toward it by receiving the signal from the bone, then it cover the bones and starts to form muscle cell.",Are bones made before flesh or both of them are formed simultaneously during embryonic development ?

biology,"&gt;The gist of zoonosis is that if the animal has a zoonotic disease, you're going to get it from simply being around them and taking care of them as opposed through only sexual contact. There is no zoonotic disease that is ONLY transmitted through sexual contact. There are vaccines for most of them, and even ignoring that, they mainly crop up in third world countries or when someone is neglecting an animal. Further, if one is afraid of zoonotic diseases due to bestiality, if the person is being consistent, then they're hopefully a lifelong celibate vegan who lives isolated from other people. You're far more likely to get sick from eating undercooked/contaminated animal products, being around other humans, or having sex. 

&gt;Ah, now you've admitted to it being gross and illegal. Gross shows you're being bigoted (reason why homosexuality was banned). And btw, legality doesn't equal right or wrong so you can't really use that in the argument (again gay marriage used to be illegal in the US). All ZOOSEXUALS are kind and never force sex on their partners, whom they love &amp; very likely take better care of than non-zoos do with their pets. As zoosexuals, we hate the ones that hurt animals. Just like we'd hate human rapists.

&gt;Zoosexuality isn't a mental disorder. Most zoos are perfectly happy and healthy, even as they speak about it with their therapists. Saying that all zoos are mentally ill is literally just like how we used to say all gays were mentally ill.

Hey everyone, I bought a heart rate monitor at the start of lockdown as I was doing lots of training and thought it might provide some interesting data.

When weight training I've noticed an odd recovery in my heart rate. When doing reps the heart rate increases consistently as expected. However when I stop, every single time, there is an odd bump in the recovery. I have tried googling to find out what may be causing it but no luck and I was hoping someone here could shed some light on it.

An example of what I'm talking about can be seen here: https://imgur.com/a/iOtUu6X

I've labelled it to make it easier to understand;  
1) Start reps (10 each)  
2) Stop reps  
3) The bump in recovery can be seen the whole way along the chart.  

There is exactly 2 minutes between the start of reps each time. The heart rate monitor is not a watch, its one worn around the upper arm for improved accuracy. As I have been aware of the bump appearing in the graph I have been making a concious effort to not do anything unusual between reps. So the bump is not caused by moving around or drinking water etc.

I'm really curious to know what causes the blip in recovery. Should I be concerned? Or is this perfectly normal? If so what is the physiological reason for it happening?

Thanks for your time",What causes the unexpected bump in my heart rate recovery?

A friend and I recently started a seminar series on Twitch, which we call [ThinksWithTwitch](https://twitch.tv/thinkswithtwitch).

Each Thursday night we bring on one of our friends to give a short talk about their research in some area of STEM followed by a Q&amp;A.

Title: Open Sourcing Medicine Discovery

Where: [twitch.tv/thinkswithtwitch](http://twitch.tv/thinkswithtwitch)

When: Thursday 6/11, 545PM PST, Talk starts at 6PM PST

Abstract: Discovering new medicine has traditionally required the use of proprietary methods and software. This reliance on proprietary techniques stops companies and academics from easily sharing know-how between projects, slows down the discovery of new medicine and raises costs. The DeepChem project aims to build an open source foundation for medicine discovery by creating a high quality suite of software and protocols that can enable scientists and engineers to work together to find better medicine faster.

I work in a big academic institute that hires hundreds of researchers and, although I have not met everyone, I can count the number of black researchers around me in one hand. To provide some context, the setting is in a big liberal city in America, with many workers being foreign nationals. 

As a non-underrepresented minority (sorry for the double negatives), I feel strongly for racial justice and equality. I also understand that there have been MANY systematic issues that contribute to the current inequality and hold black Americans back from good education (i.e. personal safety concerns, lack of supportive environment, financial instability, imbalanced resource distribution, just to name a few).  

Of the shamefully few black Americans I encountered in my relatively young career, I’ve made a friend who is a wonderful researcher and medical doctor. I have also mentored a terribly unqualified post-graduate student that looked perfect on paper with lots of research experience, who had a hard time grasping the concept of the most basic methods (think PCR or cell dissociation) after multiple people EILI5.

Can we promote equality and acknowledge the unjust starting point of education while maintaining the quality of higher education? Is it right to have two different standards because of someone’s skin color? If so, is that truly just or would that be another form of racism?

It's obvious that blood vessels are very successful at delivering fluid to very different scales and they're able to do so while continuously distributing to different parts of the body by large vessels but also irrigating even the furthest portion of tissue. Of course the system also has to return the blood to the beginning and everything has to be done precisely, with no shunts, no unirrigated parts and minimal loss of energy.

Now, there are three possible outcomes if two glyphosate-resistant transgenic plants undergo sexual reproduction:-

1. A glyphosate-resistant seed is produced which contains only glyphosate-resistant genes.
2. A glyphosate-resistant seed is produced which contains both the glyphosate-resistant gene and the non-glyphosate-resistant gene.

 If one were to mix human DNA with skin cells from mice, would the skin cells be able to grow? Would it be safe to say that the skin cells would be able to grow using the human DNA? I would say that because DNA is DNA, the skin cells might be able to use the human DNA if the skin cells find DNA that they could use to build proteins. However, this could come with complications, as it could lead to multiple copies of proteins that the skin cells would use, thus jeopardizing the skin cells. Also, there could be a chance that the foreign DNA could be broken down or alter the cells enough that they would be deemed unfavorable, and thus be destroyed. There could also be a possibility that the skin cells might have too much DNA, as they could try to incorporate the human DNA, thus causing the cells to be destroyed.",Mixing animal DNA and Human DNA

biology,"I have been worrying about this for a while, so I want to know what you all think, is this study worrying? (This isn't the only one, I believe there to be about 4 more). Before you ask, the theory is that these results indicate oxidative stress which can cause cancer. Study:

### Background

Nowadays mobile phone is very popular, causing concern about the effect it has on people’s health. Parotid salivary glands are in close contact to cell phone while talking with the phone and the possibility of being affected by them. Limited studies have evaluated the effect of cell phone use on the secretions of these glands; so this study was designed to investigate the effects of duration of mobile phone use on the total antioxidant capacity of saliva.

### Methods

Unstimulated saliva from 105 volunteers without oral lesions collected. The volunteers based on daily usage of mobile phones were divided into three groups then total antioxidant capacity of saliva was measured by Ferric Reducing Ability of Plasma (FRAP) method. Data were analyzed by SPSS software version 19. ANOVA was used to compare 3 groups and post-hoc Tukey test to compare between two groups.

### Results

Average total antioxidant capacities of saliva in 3 groups were 657.91 µmol/lit, 726.77 µm/lit and 560.17 µmol/lit, respectively. The two groups had statistically significant different (*P* = 0.039).

### Conclusion

Over an hour talking with a cell phone decreases total antioxidant capacity of saliva in comparison with talking less than twenty minutes.

Hey everyone! I hope it's okay to post this here, I'd love some perspectives on my particular situation as I've read a lot of opinions and am going over some ideas about a career change.

I'm currently in my late 20s, working as a freelance content writer/occasional journalist and am finding it far less steady and fulfilling than I'd hoped.

I've been taking stock of things while in lockdown and am considering trying out a career shift into lab tech work.

Now, I graduated with a BA in English and haven't studied sciences since school. By far my best science was biology, and I'd be interested in the idea of working in a biosciences/medical lab as an assistant/technician.

From what I can see on job boards in the UK, there are positions open for apprenticeships or entry-level positions which don't require any particular experience.

I'm looking at possibilities for study and am considering taking a biology diploma/access/refresher course and then perhaps even trying for a biology degree with the Open University (distance learning) while getting an entry-level job, as it's far more affordable and flexible than a standard degree.

Now, I still absolutely have to consider if this would be a wise move, especially as my science skills are extremely rusty (I've been going over school-level biology in preparation and finding it really engaging so far, but some kind of formal study seems wise. I'd definitely get my feet wet in the field before making any drastic moves in any case). I have a few concerns/questions:

\-Would a distance learning course in science be any good at all for someone who's interested in lab tech work? The degrees I'm looking at involve occasional lab placements, but no sustained lab experience. I thought perhaps an apprenticeship/entry-level lab tech position would be good to do alongside a part-time degree, if I decide to go that route. It would also show an interest in science to potential employers.

\-A lot of people say lab tech work is unfulfilling, is that always the case? I really want to do something where I feel I'm contributing to something worthwhile, and even if I was cleaning a lab and organising samples, etc. I feel that would be a lot more fulfilling than anything else I can feasibly imagine doing. Am I glamorising it too much?

\-A lot of people say there's little (if any) room for career advancement in lab tech work, but is that necessarily true? I'm not too concerned about salary as long as I can cover my basic needs and feel like I'm doing worthwhile work.

Thanks so much in advance for reading my long post, and I'd love any input people can give. I will absolutely consider whether my science skills are strong enough before making any long-term decisions, but would just like some input at this early stage.

My best friend became sick two weeks ago, at first, he seemed to be getting better, fever was going down, cough was getting weaker, etc.

biology,"Hi everyone, I work as a protected species observer (PSO) and the company I contract for is looking to recruit more observers for upcoming projects.

Whats a PSO? When a company wants to do a marine geological survey of any kind, be it oil, windmills, or construction, they are required to have PSO onboard to watch out for Marine Mammals, Sea turtles, and other protected species to mitigate any potential damage the survey equipment can cause.

What do I need to be a PSO? Theres a few certifications that are required, as well as your own gear. After you've gotten everything certified you'll probably be $2000 in the hole, however you easily earn this amout back after your first month. The nice thing is if you file your taxes you can write off most of the expenses on your taxes. I can earn a sign up bonus for everyone I recruit so to prevent people from just reading this post and going through the certification themselves, I wont list everything, gotta look out for #1.

Whats a day in the life of a PSO like? Im currently working on a video about this very thing. You pretty much stare at the ocean on a boat, miles from land until you spot a protected species. Then after figuring out if the animal is close enough to be potentially affected by the survey equipment you get to shut down the boats operations. There are incredibly boring days, and there are incredible days where youll see 12 Humpback whales feeding in an upwelling next to the boat, or a group of 70 dolphins follow the boat for hours. We also see tons of other wildlife, sharks, birds, turtles, ect. You have to fill out paper work on the protected species but thats pretty much the hardest thing you have to do. I listen to podcasts, music, and audio books while I am on watch, so you can be some what productive. The Starting pay for PSOs is a day rate and is typically 150-200 a day, but I've been doing this for a year already and have made more than 300$ a day on some projects.

A typical schedule is not something I've had in my exeperience as a PSO. Some PSOs work a constant 5 week on, 5 week off shift. This has not been my experience. Im currently on a project expected to last 2 months, Ive also been projects as short as 11 days. But I also follow the money, whereever the highest pay is, is usually where I am, but some people might prefer a lower day rate in exchange for a more consistent schedule. Thats gonna be more your call.

Whats life like offshore? Mostly what you make of it. I work about 13 hours a day, and out of that time I am on watch for 7-8 hours. the rest of my time, I finish paper work. I also work on scripts for my youtube channel, edit photographs of animals I've seen, work out, eat, watch movies.

What are some disqualifying things for working offshore? The internet is pretty shit offshore, just enough to send emails, and texts, so if you need daily internet this job isnt for you. Honestly though, its wonderful to unplug for a few weeks at a time. Also if you experience motion/sea sickness easily, however most people adapt after a few days. You also need to pass a drug test, which is a huge bummer when you work out of states that are recreationally legal (looking at you Massachusetts). Medical marijuana is still disqualifying, theres no exceptions, they will straight up call a helicopter to pick you up if you fail an on vessel drug test.

Some perks. You get paid to watch wildlife. You get paid pretty well. You can log your sea days for a captains license. International work on all seven continents and all five oceans is a availible (You'll have to be competitive for them however). You can get certifications in Passive acoustic monitoring (Opens up more international work, and higher pay.)

TL;DR: Get paid to watch marine life.

biology," 

I've always ""knew"" that I should either use disposable mask, or sanitized them after every use. It's a very rooted educatoin as I survived SARS in Hogn Kong. Then I heard the opinion of someone else and logically, it seems like they are correct. And I am very confused right now.

We don't need to wash mask because virus, like COVID-19 needs a host to duplicate. So even if there is a few COVID-19 on there, they won't be able to duplicate. After say... 30 days, they will just starve to death. So reusing unwashed mask have a very low risk as the number of COVID 19 will remain few on the mask as they don't duplicate.

I could not argue with that logic. That got me thinking though, wouldn't that apply to all pathogen?

As a mask is not the ideal medium, wouldn't all pathogen be unable to duplicate much on a mask? Say if we were to soak the mask in some salted water first, wouldn't that hugely decrease the amount of pathogen who can survive being on the mask? And if we were to never wash the mask, would the waste product of the mask eventually makes whatever is living on the mask uninhabitable?

This not washing mask logic defied everything I have been taught. Please counter this logic.",Why can't we reuse mask?

I'm studying biomedical science and have recently done a fair amount of work on cancer so I'm basing my speculation only what I know from that - I do not have a complete understanding of the subject.

It's my understanding that we're able to treat certain diseases by inserting a gene into a virus and using it on a human to cause expression of that gene. It's also my understanding that a huge issue of treating cancers comes from being unable to distinguish between healthy and mutated cells as they barely differ externally in any ways that matter.

If we were to insert genes for DNA checking enzymes into cancer patients and stimulate their synthesis using viruses, in theory could we make more likely that mutated cells will be noticed by sheer number of increased checks? The logic being that it would cause no harm to healthy cells when they reproduce, but would be able to signal to have any mutated cells dealt with.

I suspect it wouldn't work since:

\- I'm not sure if quantity of DNA checks is the cause of mutations not being corrected

\- I don't know if the mechanism of DNA checking would allow for an increase of checks in this manner

\- I'm aware many cancerous mutations form resistance to apoptosis 

\- I'm not sure if using a virus as a vector would be suitable to 'infect' target cells with enough accuracy.

I figured this would be the best place to ask people who know a hell of a lot about this subject what the issue with this approach would be? I've done some basic research on how chemotherapies and immunotherapies work but that's about as far into treatments I've looked.

biology," 

Ill start with these four postulates.

1. 23andMe and other DNA testing companies do not provide enough information on South Asian ancestry.
2. There isn't enough samples from South Asians to compare to in these DNA testing company databases.
3. Due to the fact that your DNA has too much information to deal with (and some of it is probably not relevant to your ancestry), the companies target specific regions of your genome that make individuals unique (SNPs).
4. These SNPs are described in the raw data file that the company provides.

SO my questions are:

1. Is the lack of specific information pertaining to South Asian ancestry caused because a lack of samples results in:  

   1. a lack of information to compare your data to?  

      1. *If only this point is the case, then I'm ecstatic, because I can just upload my raw data from a site like 23andMe to any other database online that has more South Asian samples to compare to.*
   2. a lack of information, and therefore an inability to determine which SNPs are required to provide specifics on South Asian ancestry (I'm assuming that the level of specificity in the provided information is related to the amount of SNP's \[and which SNPs\] targeted)?  

      1. *If this is the case then that sucks. I guess I can still upload my raw data to a database with more South Asian samples, but because of the fact that the SNPs that are targeted are not unique enough, I wont be able to get enough information or I wont get accurate information on my ancestry from any database no matter how full it is*
2. Which ancestry test would be the best to get a raw data file for a South Asian, and which database would be the best for uploading that raw data file?  

   1. *Although, if there is a testing company out there that provides a comprehensive enough analysis for South Asians (which I doubt), then you don't need to mention an external database.*
3. Do companies really give you ALL the SNP information in that raw data file, or do they leave out some information?",Is there a Good DNA Test for South Asians?!?

That being said I have a question.

What is the correct order that you are supposed to write a scientific report?

I am writing a report for my school and my teacher is being annoying. They laid out weird order to make the report so I just made the report in a random order that felt better doing, so if anyone could tell me the proper order that you should make a scientific report in then that would be appreciated :D

Just to be clear, my school did not tell me the correct order. the beginning is fine, they wanted me to pick a subject, method, and make the questions that the report is supposed to answer so that is fine. But then they wanted me to perform the lab, collect the data from the lab, write down the purpose of the lab after it is done which seems strange to do after the lab instead of before. And after the lab is done and I have written down the result, materiel, and method. Now they want me to delimit the purpose of the lab, and as the last thing, they want me to write the theory and refer to other research in the subject, discussion, abstract and the sources used.

So I am just a little confused

My impression is that you are supposed to pick the subject, method, purpose, questions, and do research on the subject before you do the lab itself but I am not sure. So anyone that wants to give me a step by step guide on how scientific report is supposed to be performed would be much appreciated.

Now I wrote before that I have done the lab and written the report so you might be wondering why I still want to know the order. Well... I am gonna rewrite the report because no matter what I do my teacher still seems to have something to complain about so I might as well remake it in the proper order so that I know it for future projects.

biology,"I'm not too educated in biology other than the occasional articles I read, and the highschool education I have. I work as a bagger and trimmer at a slaughterhouse. I trim nasty stuff off the carcasses; cysts, fecal matter, pieces of hide, etc. I also sometimes vaccum seal the finished cuts some days. Working there I've noticed certain things that I never would have expected. Here's some of the questions I have.

1. Why does fat have such a low melting point?
1. A) how does the body keep fat solid? (If it does keep it solid 
1. B) when the body uses fat does it actually ""burn it"" or are the fat crystals broken apart at the molecular level? 

A lot of the fat from the lambs will melt in my hand and on my knife. Now I am grabbing and cutting through this meat so it's possible friction could generate some heat and cause some of the melting but I am not sure. It seems like a lot of the fat in the lambs should be liquid at the temperature their body stays at. 
My theory right now is that the fat cells have some sort of lining that surrounds them and keeps everything nice and orderly and solid like. But when these cells are cut the loose fat cells are released and any that are hot enough to melt spill out. I don't think each cell has a cell wall but maybe groups of cells form in pockets. 

2) Where does energy in a bled and headless body come from? 

After the lamb have been killed (I hate this makes me sad hope I can find a new job soon) they seize. The beheaded bodies often have muscle contractions for minutes at a time, I want to say twenty minutes(time also drags in there so maybe its shorter). The seizures start with flailing legs and near the end it's just muscle contractions in the glutes. If blood carrys energy for these cells what is powering these contractions? I assume muscle can store energy but the electrical signal they receive is what causes them to flex so where is that coming from? 

3) Why are kidneys enveloped in fat but other organs aren't?

This may be a lamb specific thing but I've never cut anything else open so I can't say for sure. I've noticed the kidneys have a thick layer of fat surrounding them. None of the other organs (that I've noticed) do. The liver is really delicate so I don't think the fat is protective or the liver would have the same thing, or so I would think? 
Maybe the kidneys just need a lot of energy? Or maybe it helps them filter better?

biology,"Around Christmas, I made a simple syrup infused with clementines by boiling clementines in a concentrated simple syrup.  I then put the simple syrup in a jar and left it in the fridge, occasionally pulling it out to use a tablespoon or two to sweeten a cocktail.

In the last month or so, unbeknownst to me, something began to grow in the jar which was sitting at the back of my fridge:

[https://imgur.com/a/ZLpW89E](https://imgur.com/a/ZLpW89E)

Initially I thought it might be some kind of crystallization as the syrup is very thick (consistency of a runnier honey). However, upon inspection I realized that it looks more like a bacterial colony, made up of tiny even-sized circular nodules. There is no apparent smell, but I mixed a small amount with water in a beaker and the resulting liquid is somewhat opaque (similar to a yeast slurry) whereas the original syrup was crystal clear when mixed with water. 

Does anyone have ANY idea what this might be? Could it be a wild yeast of some kind? Without a microscope or other microbiology tools, is there any way I can find out more about what this might be?

For what it's worth, since I suspected that it might be yeast I have left the resulting solution in a beaker to see if it begins to ferment. Overnight, there appears to have been no obvious fermentation activity. I'll update if that changes.

biology,"*I am not in any way trying to discuss how deadly the virus is or is not, but rather simply how very contagious it is in terms of ability to affect number of people.

I read somewhere that measles was considered one of the most contagious airborne viruses and the coronavirus is more contagious than even that. Reasons for this include its ability to rapidly multiply in the throat in a very short number of days which leads to spreading the viral load and also that the viral load contained per sneeze droplet on average was also extraordinarily high. In conjunction with the fact that the virus also has a random (and possibly quite long) number of days before someone may show symptoms (2-14 days) or even if they show symptoms at all, all the while the person remains potentially infectious to others, is this as bad as a virus can get in terms of spreading quickly?

Of course, it can be reasoned on the other hand that of in fact the virus had like a 95% kill rate it wouldn't spread very much at all because word about something with a death rate that high would stop it (more or less).

In his lectures, Hayes presents images of frogs with both testes and ovaries. A 2010 Hayes study concluded that atrazine rendered 75% of male frogs sterile and turned one in 10 into females.

The controversy emerges from Hayes claiming that other studies contending his findings were influenced by funding from Syngenta, the company that developed Atrazine. His case is pretty compelling as it's told in these two articles:

biology,"Hi there,

First post, have been developing these ideas over the last few years and I think it's time I took some feedback, for some basics about me, I'm 23, I've a degree in Biochemistry and I've always had a much more long term view of life than most, I'm not religious in any conventional sense, and although what I'm about to describe could be considered beliefs, I prefer to think of them as evidence based conclusions.

To begin I'd like to question the narrative put forward by religions to those who lacked faith for centuries, that without a belief in a higher power, something to judge our actions and determine them right or wrong based on its own rules, we would be lawless, hedonistic savages. This is of course, a baseless claim, but it brings up a good point, what is the ultimate goal, if not to pass a creators test?

I believe the answer has been in front of us since we discovered that we too, like the rest of life on this planet, are biological machines, with the instructions on how to build, maintain and operate these machines encoded in our DNA. It seems strange to me why philosophers have argued over what life's purpose is, when all of life's code is targeted towards a single goal, from the smallest Virus to the largest Mammal, the primary function of all life is to reproduce and spread.

""Great!"" I hear you say, ""so my purpose is to get out there and have kids? That's easy!"" and whilst yes, that is a way of fulfilling life's primary function, it is not the optimal way that we as modern humans can. You see, as far as we know, we are the only species not just capable of experiencing and understanding the universe, but also the only species with any chance of spreading conscious life beyond earth. 

That is what i believe our purpose is, simply put, if we stay on earth, we are limiting the amount of people that can ever live, that can ever experience life and the universe and that's why I believe it is not just our purpose, but our responsibility to dedicate our lives to ensuring that future becomes a reality.

This is where my view on Morality comes into play, as with a now definitive goal of life, the morality of an action is determined by its potential contribution to the goal, for example, actions that cause people harm are generally going to have a negative impact on the goal whilst actions that allow people to lead healthier, happier and better educated lives will contribute to that goal.

I'm sure there are caveats to this Moral basis, which I'm hoping you can point out, theories can't be developed without challenge, but so far I haven't been able to fault this system and in comparison to what else is available out there in terms of moral guidance, nothing fits my views like this.

Finally I'd just like to answer the question I wish more people would ask, ""What can I do to further humanity? To make my life have counted towards this goal?""

That's simple, help people, but further than that, try and make it your career to help people, there are so many ways of contributing in this way, working in STEM fields is the one I believe is most effective and accessible, but the world needs more than that, we need charity workers who care about the people alive today as well as those STEM workers focused on the future, we need politicians more concerned with a populations well-being than their reelection and we need social leaders who stand for progress instead of regression.

But now, I'm quite hesitant about what majors and minors should I pursue to achieve my career goals.

what are the courses required to specialize in that? Should I major in Natural sciences with biology concentration and minor in computer sciences? or should I double major in both? I also thought about taking a Business minor beside the CS minor. I see that somehow very hard even I intent to do my best, so what's your advice?  
what are the careers opened to me after?  
on the other hand, How can I be ready for an MD or PharmD degree after graduation?

Not so long ago, I found an insect staying still near my window. I did not know what it was, so I decided to find out about it with an app. The app identified it as a 'Mayfly' and it said that it lives for only 24h after they transform into imago, mate and starve to death. 

Well, first day I saw it, I was expecting it to die the following day so I came to check the next morning and slightly touched it with a pen. It responded by moving its legs and tail. Then the day after I touched it again, and it was still alive. I almost forgot about it for a week, and it is still alive. Well, it just stays there still (unless I touch it).

biology,"I'm hoping to apply for a Biology PhD in the fall, coming from a US undergraduate background, and would be interested in applying to some international (likely European) programs. Here, it's common for someone with an bachelor's to apply directly to ~5-6 year PhD programs that often include a Master's degree. Internationally, it seems much more common to have separate Master's degree programs (~2 years) and then PhD programs (~3 years). 

While the total time is similar, a big difference seems to be that you have to pay for the Master's degree in the international system, whereas in the US you're typically receiving a PhD stipend throughout the program. One exception I found is the [Max Planck Matter To Life](https://www.maxplanckschools.de/en/matter-to-life) school, which looks more like US programs. What other programs are like this?

biology,"With a group of friends we decided to build a microscope in our free time. We are looking for inspiration and ideas to narrow our focus and the specifications of the hardware. Even though we are firm believers of open-hardware/open-science, we also pursue the idea of making the microscope commercially available. Therefore, it would be great to read about how do you use a microscope, what would you do to a microscope if it would be fully hackable? 

Below, the long read:

## Our inspiration
There are many open-hardware microscopes around, such as the [UC2](https://nanoimaging.de/opensource-microscopy/uc2-open-source-optical-toolbox-multi-modal-imaging-incubator/), [MicroscoPy](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/684423v1) (by IBM), and [OctoPi](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/684423v1). However, none of this projects is commercially available, and OctoPi, much to my regret, is just a preprint, it is not open-hardware yet, beyond their claims. Therefore, we want to start a project that is open-hardware, open-source not as an after thought but since the beginning. 

## Our Idea
Microscopes are a tool broadly used, but their true power comes from the techniques built around them. For example, measuring particle sizes through Brownian diffusion, detecting parasites, determining tissue composition through fluorescence, and many, many more. We believe there is room for hackable microscopes, that can be used as a learning or prototyping platform, pretty much in the same sense that Arduino boards are used now a days. 

## Why Commercial 
We don't want to just build a new open-hardware microscope. We would like to build and bring it to the next level, by making it commercially available. In a lot of the open-hardware microscopes, building comes down to sourcing parts from Aliexpress or eBay, with fluctuating qualities and availability. Moreover, sourcing parts on Aliexpress is usually not compatible with how labs process purchases. 

## Our Doubts
Microscopes can have plenty of features and applications. But since we come from the physics world, we are missing plenty. Therefore, we are seeking for ideas regarding what people look for on microscopes. Who uses fluorescence, white-light light transmission, dark-field. What image-processing pipelines do people use. One of the biggest challenges is making it affordable to our pockets. We can't spend 10k on an objective or filters, since it is, for the time being, a side-project, completely bootstrapped. 

## Our ideal roadmap
1.- Start with a simple, white-light microscope, that allows to resolve down to single bacteria. I.e. being able to see yeast in one's kitchen
2.- Find applications, for example using the microscope in an incubator (is this something people care about?), what would be the use of a portable microscope in field work? Perhaps looking at bacteria in water? 
3.- Adding image processing pipelines. Measuring quantities, identifying cells(?)
4.- Launching pre-order campaigns
5.- Secure suppliers, manufacturing, etc. 
6.- Where next? More features? Strengthen current features?","Starting an open-hardware microscope, would love your feedback"

How valid is this? Are the methods really as flawed as he says they are? If so, how has this not been addressed/ how *is* it addressed in studies?

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;The Flynn effect indicates again that a view of IQ as innate is erroneous (p29-p30)

But the Flynn effct only shows that IQ has changed over time, right?. In an assessment of people today from (what is assumed to be on average) a similar environment, it doesn't play a role, right? So this doesn't disprove anything. We're smarter than an 18th century coal-miner, who knew? (Plus, hasn't it been shown that this trend has inverted in the last two decades?)

* **The compound targets folate metabolism and membrane integrity which are two different mechanisms within one molecule. Scientists are hoping that this discovery will lead to a better new type of antibiotics.**
* **One of the weaknesses of antibiotics is that bacteria mutates quickly to resist them. The Princeton team found that they were unable to generate any resistance to this compound.**

* **An SCH derivative called Irresistin-16 can be used to treat gonorrhea infection in mice.**
* **The team was able to test the compound against the gonorrhea-causing bacteria that is resistant to every known antibiotic and the compound killed the strain.**
* **This research should be significant because antibiotic resistance is on the rise outpacing the discovery of new antibiotics which creates a global health crisis.**
* **Drug regulators has not been approved new antibiotics to treat Gram-negative disease-causing bacteria for almost 30 years.**

I'm now 22, and i would like to finish my highschool via highschool for adults, and go the University in my city to study Biology. But i have no clue what i should study to achieve that goal. What do i have to study?",What do i need to study in High school to study Biology in University?
biology,"Hi guys,

I'm one of those Biology majors that currently feels lost. I attended college and have just graduated recently with a BS in Biology. Honestly, I applied to colleges deciding to pursue biology because I enjoyed science in high school. Med school did run through my mind early on, but ultimately I decided that I didn't want to go that way. I managed to get a GPA decently above 3, but not anything I would brag about.

Anyway, I've been looking at posts and online forums (like on Reddit) about what to do with a Biology degree. Pharmaceutical sales, QA, etc. have been some options I've seen in order to get into the business side of these corporations, which I was intrigued by. I recently submitted a couple applications and just heard from one company, for the position titled ""Pharmaceutical Sales Rep – Entry Level and Experienced"". Now, of course I read its description and was applying to the Entry Level portion of the application. However, when they responded saying they were beginning an interview process and want to know what would work for me, they stated that I need ""Pharmaceutical sales training"" and ""some sales experience/abilities"". I've never worked in sales, let alone pharmaceutical sales or industries, only some small and part-time customer service jobs. I guess while I've seen that there are some pharmaceutical sales courses online for training, I assumed this would be part of the job if I got hired to the Entry level position. Is there anyone in pharmaceutical sales that can share their journey to getting their position/attest to if this? Is sales experience a necessity? Do I need to either find a company that will hire someone with no experience, or get the training online?

Furthermore, if you guys have any other suggestions or advice for someone in my position I'd greatly appreciate it. I understand the Biology degree is oversaturated and grad-school is an option and ideal in many circumstances, but as of now I am not interested in going that way.

Thanks!",Pharmaceutical sales entry-level jobs

I apologize for all the mistakes, I am from Ukraine and I used a translator

All the links and sources from which I took information and everything I need for development, I will leave, this is not advertising, maybe someone will come in handy.

I must say right away, before that I had never created games and was not involved in programming, I worked as a rehabilitologist for 5 years.

Every day I worked with patients with various disorders, ranging from post-stroke patients with hemiparesis to patients with Korsakov’s syndrome, however, the greatest interest was in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), especially how their pathology affects their perception of the world, and how they adapted to their characteristics, people were of different ages and with different intellectual abilities.

For 4 years, I performed various physical and cognitive tasks with them, which were aimed at improving their emotional state, developing fine motor skills of hands, reducing stereotyped behavior, improving socialization, imagination, and memory.

According to official figures, in America, every 68 children have ASD, this problem is very relevant and I decided to try to make my contribution and try, at least partially, to help people with ASD. After reading many works on the impact of educational games and video games on people with ASD (if you are interested, here are a few of them [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40489-014-0018-5](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40489-014-0018-5), [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-015-0522-x](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12888-015-0522-x), [https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-11623-5\_9](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-11623-5_9) )   
 

In rehabilitation there are classical methods that have been used for years, these are canons that are generally accepted.  
For example, in the rehabilitation of people with dyslexia always use multisensory **Orton-Gillingham method.**  
**CFMT** is used in the rehabilitation of people with prosopagnosia.  
I was surprised how high their effectiveness is, compared with classic **Segen boards**, **Domanat cards**, **PECS systems,**  **Beasyboards**  and other standard game rehabilitation elements, and such high efficiency of video games and developmental games is shown through the interest of children in the rehabilitation process and their maximum involvement in this process.

The choice was between a video game and a educational game, talking with my patients, their parents and attending a rehabilitation conference in Dresden, where I also had the opportunity to talk with people with ASD - I came to the conclusion that the target audience is more interested in the educational game.

I immediately began to learn more about the features of UI / UX design for people with ASD ( [https://www.designmantic.com/community/designing-for-autistic.php](https://www.designmantic.com/community/designing-for-autistic.php) )

Throughout the development process, I consulted with other specialists, I was greatly helped by occupational therapists and neurologists who also work daily with children with ASD, and in the early stages I was helped by pediatricians, psychologists and physical therapists, I was able to create a multidisciplinary team whose members They helped me a lot with creating the concept of the application and together we were able to come up with the best way for the child to interact with the game. We took into account that the application can be downloaded by people of different age groups, and with a greater / lesser manifestation of specific features of ASD.

I tried to make all levels as comfortable as possible for people with ASD, starting from colors that meet all ADS standards and ending with building levels where I tried to minimize the number of alternative answers that could distract the child.

I tried to make a special emphasis in tasks on the recognition of emotions; in everyday life it is very difficult for people with ASD. I read a lot of literature on this subject, and used the system that Paul Ekman and Wallace Friesen developed back in 1978, although FACS was primarily used only for analyzing facial expressions and was used in psychology, it helped me a lot. Also, in problems with the choice of emotions, emphasis was placed on fixing the right choice, by repeated repetition, as practice shows - this approach is very effective and significantly improves memorization.

Most tasks are classic tasks for children with ASD, but are adapted and presented in the form of a game.

During the entire phase of the creation of the game, I consulted with people with ASD, my patients became the first focus group.

The development took about two years, a lot of time was spent reading scientific papers and communicating with people with ASD. Also, a significant part of the time was spent communicating with colleagues who gave their advice and partly took part in the development; it also took a lot of time to draw tasks and find answers to the question about programming in Android Studio.

For more than three months ago, I finished the development of the game, but before publishing, I decided to give it to my patients with ASD so that they could use the application for three months and be able to tell their opinion, and I could evaluate the effectiveness. I also visited all schools for children with special needs that are in the city, and showed the finished application to children with ASD, I asked them to use it for three months, and after three months I returned to talk with them again to evaluate the result.

Some of the children were not able to use the game due to the difficult financial situation and lack of phones, so I gave my previous phones (Samsung Galaxy Gio, Samsung Galaxy S3 and Nokia Lumia 1020) to three children, the models are not new, but the application was installed and you can use them, so I decided to give them to children, I did not use them anyway.

Three months later, the children's parents noted that they and their children were very happy, the children's concentration, memory and emotional state improved significantly, their level of socialization and ability to interpret other people's actions and emotions improved.

Also, many of my acquaintances who have healthy children (without ASD) installed the application, the children liked it very much and the parents noted the improvement of cognitive abilities and memory in children. Therefore, as practice shows, the application can be useful for all children.

Even if the application does not become popular, but can help at least one child - I will be the happiest person in the world!

So can taking niacin help? since it is a major component of NAD and NADP, two coenzymes involved in cellular metabolism.

biology,"While researching i only kept reading that different foods have a different timeline they need to be digested. Being fruit and some veggies at the shortest and meat and fish at its longest. I do understand that there are many factors involved and that probably there is a median time for digesting.

But, under the premise one would eat a single type of food, how does the digestive system know, how long it needs to digest?

There must be a system of recognition to produce the appropriate enzymes and juices to split it. But i was also thinking that there must be some kind of ""check"" system that gives feedback on how much the food has broken down, how much nutriens are left, if it is ready for the next tract, if it has gone bad, and all that.

I found that it is a rather complex system, but i haven't found any information on this question other than: ""nerve endings in the digestive system communicate with the brain to slow down the movement, control the production of juices and release it into the next stage.""

But how?

The above explanation does seem way too simple for me. There must be messenger substances involved, but i didn't find anything about that. Also some sources seemed to be contradicting. Some saying the brain controls it, some saying the brain only let's you know if you need to be eat, drink and use the bathroom, but the digestive process remains internal.

I believe that the body acts highly efficent, so i doubt it randomly splurrs in EVERY enzyme and juice on a go get lucky basis.

This idea suddenly popped in my head last night and I couldn’t sleep for an hour wondering about it. So it all started when we ate a very tasty chubby fish earlier. I was thinking this fish looks fat but it’s shape was shape like any other fish of its kind. But you can’t call a fish fat and even if it’s bigger than most of it’s own you will never see a fish that has fat in targeted areas that change its shape. I believe it’s the same for any animal that comes in mind. I don’t think I’ve ever seen an overweight wild animal but I’ve seen fat dogs or cats which still don’t look like they are storing fat in weird ways. So can it be explained how humans get for example side belly fat or arm fat or any fat that changes the initial shape we are born with? Human are animals too so what makes us store fat in uneven ways??? It’s not like animals don’t eat weird unhealthy stuff too or like they do a specific workout🤣Please someone that has any scientific clue about it enlighten me or I’m gonna loose my sleep for a lot more nights trying to research the tiny amount of information that comes up 😅

1. The carcass which is 8-meter long was found near the mouth of the Amazon river last Friday.

2. No wounds has been found anywhere on the body, but there were few clues to explain how this creature ended up so far from the water.

3. Specialist still not sure how it ended there, but we're speculating that the creature was floating too close to the shore and the tide picked it up and slammed it inland into the mangrove.

4. Not only was the whale found remarkably far from shore, it was also found in the exact opposite season you'd expect to see humpbacks in this region.

5.  Looking at the size of the carcass, biologists think the whale is probably a juvenile less than one year old.

6. Biologists suspect that the baby whale somehow lost its mother during migration, and that's why it was left behind in the Amazon basin.

7. Another theory is that the baby whale died from ingesting plastic waste and its dead body was washed ashore during a storm.

biology,"Hey guys, 

I graduated last summer with a B.S. in Biology and immediately jumped into graduate school in a program that I thought would fit me well, it's only been one and a half semesters but I'm not very happy with my progress nor my program. It also has been rather detrimental to my mental health given that I live alone in an area I have grown tired of. I feel as though I was too quick with my decision to head off to grad school and I seriously overestimated my maturity for dealing with the workload. I believe I would have been better off taking a year or two to grow and work before deciding on a program.  I haven't talked to my advisor about this problem yet in fear that he would think less of me. I know this is a lot of supplemental information so I will get to the root of this post. Would it be possible for me to drop out of my current program and give it more time before possibly looking elsewhere, I have a 4.0 though my semesters already so it wouldn't be because of my inability but more so for my mental health. Any advice here would be greatly appreciated because I have found it very difficult to talk to my therapist or other supporting members of my life about this situation and I think an outside perspective could do me some good. It is a tough decision to make a post like this because for the first time in my academic career I don't feel like I have a direction.

If anyone is interested I am currently doing a Masters Thesis in Plant Biotechnology, thank you for your time  /endrant

One more thing, if this post isn't appropriate for this subreddit and someone has a different spot they would like to direct me towards please feel free.",Can I go back to Graduate School if I drop out for mental health reasons?

biology,"Recently, I decided to focus on learning about a specific group of plants (bryophytes) and I am starting with chemistry and books about bryophytes. However, whenever I read my chemistry and other textbooks, I tend to find a more specific chemistry or physics related topic that naturally requires learning those fields in depth to fully understand. For example, I'll read that knowledge of advanced math can help to understand how molecules and atoms interact, particularly in physical chemistry, but learning that would separate me from what I want to learn (the macroscopic) for a long time. But at the same time, I always feel a nagging feeling that I have betrayed myself by glossing over those parts. For those who have specialized in biology subjects that don't require math heavy topics like physical chemistry (and neglected other, related subjects to do so), what is a good line of thinking to let go of this feeling that I'm betraying myself? How do you rationalize the necessity of glossing over. Thank you, and I hope this is the last nagging thought I share before I fully plunge into reading.",Giving up knowing about other fields to focus on one topic

biology,"RSV has killed 800,000 to 1 million people in the last 8 months. About 70% of those deaths are young children and the elderly. It's so sad, their deaths were completely preventable, but they had to die because of a stupid common cold and mucus ridden lungs. RSV is estimated to infect 60 million people worldwide each year, so with the deaths, that's around a 1 percent death rate, which is 10 times higher than the flu.

RIP to everyone who died of RSV this year so far. Not many people know about this deadly common cold. It's even sadder there's no vaccine for this because you're not immune to it once you get it once, twice or 100 times. It basically re infects you until you finally die of pneumonia.

For reference, every two weeks and you will have 40,000 new deaths from RSV as almost 20,000 people die from RSV each week. That is 2700 people dying every single day from just this strain of the common cold alone.",I'm crying right now. Hundreds of thousands of people are dead. This virus must be stopped.

Biology is the study of life. This is a study of the life of different species and how they interact with their environment. Biology recognizes cells as fundamental units of life, genes as inheritance units, and evolution as machines that drive the formation of new species. Learning about life has helped shape the world. It has a credible answer as to why something happened scientifically.

In Class10 Science, biology is one of the important and scoring parts. with [class 10 Biology](https://www.entrancei.com/topics-biology-class-10) Lesson Syllabus, you can learn about life processes, natural resources, environment, control, regulation and reproduction. As a biological guide for the 10th class Board exam, we offer Class 10th biological notes to help you understand the concept.
