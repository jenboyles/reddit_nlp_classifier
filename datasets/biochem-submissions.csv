Biochemistry,"I have a question about preparing a solution in regards to the final pH. I‚Äôm a chemist working in a biology job, and rely on old notes from the previous employee as well as publications I find. But I find myself getting tripped up over the way solution recipes are written when something is dissolved in a buffer.

A lot of our solutions are written as some concentration of X in buffer pH=Y. My question is does this mean to use the buffer at that pH to dilute X and then not change the pH, or is Y the FINAL pH?

For example, I‚Äôm looking at a solution I need for a HIC column. We‚Äôre using ammonium sulfate for salting out. So one of the solutions is ‚Äú3.8 M (NH4)2SO4 in TE pH=8.‚Äù 

Does this mean I dissolve my ammonium sulfate in some TE that‚Äôs at pH=8 and leave it at whatever pH it comes to, or is the FINAL pH supposed to be 8?

What confuses me further is that based on some instructions I‚Äôve read from the previous couple people, it seems like sometimes they did it the former way, and sometimes the latter way. 

From a logical standpoint, I would expect the final pH of the solution to be 8, because that‚Äôs smack in the middle of the buffering range. But I‚Äôve never seen solutions written like this in chemistry uses; it would normally be written as  ‚Äú3.8 M (NH4)2SO4 in TE, final pH=8.‚Äù

Biochemistry,"My teacher told us to go out into nature‚Äö and take a photograph with e.g. a mobile camera. My task is to explain with the help of this picture how the concepts of cellular respiration, photosynthesis, and organic compounds, map onto each other. Using the picture, I am supposed to also explain the carbon cycle. Here is the [picture ](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/698789712386588682/775735800146427904/unknown.png) I took. Below, you will find what I answered on this essay, and would appreciate if you could review it (no need on the grammar).

&gt; I know that the processes of photosynthesis, and cellular respiration, recycle a common set of chemicals: water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, and organic compounds such as glucose. But here, we don't see any glucose, because I take it to be something edible, and leaves in this picture is not edible. Further, the water in this picture is evaporating, leading to water going from one form to another, i.e. from liquid to gas. 

&gt; Glucose and other energy-rich substances that living things depend on, are derived from plants (and cyanobacteria). The plants have a unique ability to produce an organic substance from inorganic substances. Namely, they form glucose from carbon dioxide and water. It is the carbon dioxide that contributes the carbon atoms to the chain of carbon atoms that form the ""backbone"" or base of any organic molecule, in this instance, the glucose molecules. 

&gt; In addition to carbon dioxide and water, energy is required to produce glucose, which is ""charged"" with energy. The plants solve this by converting light energy from the sun, and with the help of the green substance chlorophyll, light energy is collected inside the plant. Since light is used as an energy source, the plants' production of glucose is called photosynthesis (photo = light, synthesis = composition).

&gt; In addition to glucose, oxygen is formed during photosynthesis. The oxygen gas is formed because the reactants carbon dioxide and water contain more oxygen atoms than are required for glucose production. The plants emit oxygen to the environment. Basically, photosynthesis can be described as such: 

&gt; light energy + carbon dioxide + water ‚Üí glucose + oxygen 

&gt; In order for the carbon and hydrogen atoms to be sufficient for one glucose molecule, six carbon dioxide, and six water molecules, are required. These contain an excess of oxygen atoms, and therefore, six oxygen molecules are also formed.

&gt; Most people living on this planet are dependent on plants because they need oxygen for cellular respiration. The oxygen present in the atmosphere has been formed by photosynthesis. Plants also need oxygen. It is easy to understand why animals and humans need cellular respiration.

&gt; For plants, light energy can not be saved or transported in a plant. Energy-rich molecules, on the other hand, can be saved and transported. Because the plants' cells use glucose as fuel, they can also get energy at night when it is dark. In addition, glucose can be transported to the cells of the roots, which also need energy. 

&gt; Since plants also have cellular respiration, they are also dependent on the formation of oxygen during photosynthesis. During photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water are used up while glucose and oxygen are formed. During cellular respiration, the opposite happens. Glucose reacts with oxygen to form carbon dioxide, and water. In this way, the constituent substances participate in a cycle and do not end up on Earth. Photosynthesis is powered by light energy.

&gt; During cellular respiration, the corresponding amount of energy is released. This is finally converted into heat that radiates from the organisms. Over time, the heat also radiates from the atmosphere and further into space. This means that the energy cannot be reused in a cycle. It flows through the system and therefore life on earth is constantly dependent on new energy from the sun.

&gt; During photosynthesis, light energy is converted into chemically-bound energy into glucose. Through cellular respiration and other processes, chemically-bound energy is finally converted into heat that leaves the Earth. Therefore, new energy from the sun is always needed. Substances, on the other hand, can be included in cycles and do not have to run out.","Need someone to review this essay on Cellular Respiration, and Photosynthesis, based on the picture I took of nature"

It is really important, I have to write a proposal. Any help is appreciated!! I don't want to write something that is wrong...

1. I have the genomic DNA that encodes the gene of interest YYY.
2. I clone the gene YYY into a plasmid (pXXX), which gives me pXXX-YYY. *(This plasmid has a histag, which would allow me to purify the protein after expression into a host.)*
3. I have an orthogonal MbPylRS/PylT pair. In terms of plasmid, this would be written as pMbPylRS and pPylT.
4. The pMbPylRS plasmid has certain mutations A123B and C456D allowing incorporation of a unnatural amino acid UAA. Let's call this mutated pMbPylRS plasmid just pAbcKRS.
5. The pAbcKRS plasmid has two restriction sides, namely MfeI and NheI. I use EcoRI to cut at MfeI and SpeI to cut at NheI.
6. I ligate the p4CMVE-U6-PylT section of the pPylT plasmid between the restriction sites MfeI and NheI of pAbcKRS. This gives me plasmid pAbcKRS-PylT
7. I then use the pXXX-YYY plasmid which has the gene of interest YYY as a template for mutagenesis. I replace the K81 codon of YYY by a stop codon TAG. Using the QuickChange method I form the mutant pXXX-YYY-K81TAG.
8. I then cotransform the pXXX-YYY-K81TAG with AbcKRS-PylT and express it into E.coli. To the culture medium I add the unnatural amino acid UAA and grow the cells.
9. Expression into E.coli should give YYY-UAA-histag. After purification I should obtain the protein of interest which has at the 81st amino acid an unnatural amino acid UAA, so I get YYY-UAA81. I started with YYY-K81",Unnatural amino acid mutagenesis to photocage a specific amino acid of the enzyme

**1) Describe the diverse mechanisms by which enzymes accelerate chemical reactions at biologically standard temperatures. Include discussion addressing activation energy and the enzyme-transition state complex. Diagrams to supplement discussion should be included.**

\*\* I honestly have no idea how to even begin to answer this question? \*\*

**2) How does the near attack conformation (NAC) contribute to enzyme function?** 

Near attack conformations (NACs) are ground state conformations in which the reacting atoms are at van der Waals distance and at an angle resembling the bond to be formed in the transition state. The reaction of interest must proceed to the transition state via NAC formation. In simple terms, NACs are basically a door through which the ground state must pass in order to become the transition state. The job of these conformations is to prepare the active site. It has been shown that enzymes facilitate the formation of NACs. Up to 70% of the time, these NACs are formed in enzyme active sites. What does this have to do with enzyme function? Well, I‚Äôm glad you asked. This situation affects the function of enzymes in that it creates an environment in which the proper orientation can be achieved. It also creates a favorable free energy difference between the transition site and the NAC.

**3) Compare and contrast the MWC model and KNF model of protein folding. Provide examples of enzymes which appear to fit each of these models.** 

The Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model and the Koshland-Nemethy-Filmer (KNF) model were created to describe the behavior of allosteric proteins. The MWC model, also known as the symmetry model, states that there are two possible conformational states for an allosteric protein: the R (relaxed) state and the T (taut) state. The reason for nick-naming it the symmetry model is because all the subunits in an oligomer are assumed to have the same conformation regardless of whether it is T or R. Both R-state and T-state proteins are in equilibrium, where the T conformation is favored over the R conformation (when no ligands are present). However, it is important to note that, even though this model assumes equilibrium between the conformational states, ligand binding does NOT alter the conformation of the protein here. In this model, positive effectors only bind to the R-state, while negative effectors only bind to the T-state. This model accounts for the action of allosteric effectors. 

The KNF model of protein folding is founded on the idea that ligand binding triggers a change in the conformation of a protein. If a protein is oligomeric, then there may be changes in the conformation of many neighboring subunits if there are ligand-induced conformational changes. What is happening here is that this conformational change could cause the subunits to shift from a low-affinity state to a high-affinity state. The KNF model is nick-named the sequential model due to the fact that in this model, the subunits undergo sequential changes in conformation due to ligand binding.

The primary difference between the MWC model and the KNF model has to do with the scale in which conformational changes take place. Both models suggest that protein affinity for a given ligand changes when the ligand binds, however the MWC model suggests that this happens by a quaternary conformational change involving the entire protein, while the KNF model suggests that these changes happen on the level of tertiary structure within the protein as the neighboring subunits undergo conformational changes with successive ligand binding. Another difference is that the KNF model entertains the idea of negative cooperativity, meaning that there could be a reduction in the affinity of the other binding sites of a protein for a ligand after the binding of one or more of the ligand to its subunits. Conversely, in the MWC model, the opposite is true: there is only the possibility of positive cooperativity, which means that a single conformation switch from the T- to R- states results in an increased affinity for the ligand at unligated binding sites. In this situation, ligand binding to the T-state can‚Äôt increase the amount of the protein in the low-affinity state (T-state).

For the longest time I felt like I loved and really cared about science to the point that I wanted to dedicate my career to research. In order to achieve this I have been working as an undergraduate researcher in a lab for a little over year now and recently something has sent me into a spiral. Last week I presented to the head of our lab a small introduction of some research I was taking charge on and long story short he wasn't very impressed. His biggest criticism is it didn't seem like I had a very deep understanding of what I was doing with my project and in the lab as a whole for someone who has been there for a year (granted I was booted out for 6 months of that year because of covid) mostly just basic or surface information and he would honestly be right. I have been struggling to have any motivation to actually dig into the research I am doing or the lab to the point were I start loathing going in every day and I view essential things like reading scientific papers over what I am doing or plan to do as chores that I procrastinate on to a point where my lab advisor is getting onto me about it when I should be interested and excited into delving into the subject and this has been a problem since the very beginning of me joining the lab.

Biochemistry,"Hey Friends,

I've found myself in something of an awkward professional situation. I'm a protein biochemist by trade. I have experience isolating and characterizing a great number of diverse proteins from a few weird sources, but principally from bacteria. This began to change a week or two ago.

I started to receive on the job training in mammalian cell culture techniques with a view towards ultimately transfecting, culturing and purifying proteins from mammalian cell culture. Due to some unfortunate developments in my place of work, the person teaching me is no longer available. We also had plans to develop reporter cell lines as well for testing therapeutics.

I pride myself on being diligent and clean with excellent aseptic technique skills, and even during my first couple passaging runs the comment was made that i was probably being overly cautious (but that's ok). I have solid (I'd venture even excellent) wet lab skills, but what I really need is some direction towards protocols and textbooks that folks who have experience would recommend. I've done some of my own research, and come across vendor based protcols (Thermo etc, obviously focusing on proprietary reagents and marketing) and checked the literature (Leah et al.

I'm doing this cause I needed a project topic and I was curious about the strength of conventional opioids vs synthetic opioids. It is a well known fact that fentanyl analogs can be over 100x stronger than morphine and I was hoping this strength had at least something to do with binding affinities. However, for example, the calculated binding affinity for morphine is -8.9 kcal/mol and the binding affinity of carfentanil (supposedly hundreds of times stronger than morphine) is only -7.3 kcal/mol. I know the calculation is good because I took out the ligand in the protein structure and redocked it, and it came out pretty damn close.

Do you think the reason for this be just because the potency of the agonist would be unrelated/barely related to binding affinity or would it have to be related and I'm missing something? Is that possible? Currently planning on writing this up as saying the binding affinity is not related to the potency which is totally lame.",Looking for advice on opioid potency vs. receptor binding affinity

Biochemistry,"Could someone help me out with this question from Khan Academy? I included the hints/solutions from the website. The question basically asks, which of the following is least likely to result in a mutated protein (that the question calls ABC kinase, which is in the mutated, or constitutively active, form)?

(Choice A, Incorrect) A point mutation in the promoter region for the Abc gene

(Choice B, Incorrect) A deletion of the portion of the gene that codes for Abc‚Äôs regulatory domain.

(Choice C, Correct) A two nucleotide insertion at the beginning of the coding region.

(Choice D, Incorrect) A reciprocal translocation that separates two halves of an intron

Hint 1

The question asks for which occurrence is LEAST likely to result in a constitutively active Abc kinase. So it‚Äôs actually asking about which occurrence might be detrimental to or not affect Abc kinase activity.

Hint 2

Regulatory domains often suppress protein activity.

Hint 3

Recall that three nucleotides form a codon, which codes for a specific amino acid in the resulting peptide chain.

Hint 4

Point mutations involve the substitution of one nucleotide for another. This can result in a different amino acid being incorporated into the peptide chain.

Hint 5

An insertion of two nucleotides at the beginning of the coding region would necessarily alter the reading frame of the ribosome, which would alter all codons downstream of the mutation and likely produce a dysfunctional protein.

Hint 6

A two nucleotide insertion at the beginning of the coding region would be very unlikely to result in a constitutively active Abc kinase because of this frameshift mutation.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I don't understand at all how A and D could be wrong. A would produce a mutation where the polymerase binds (promoter region), which would be unlikely to result in a dysfunctional expressed protein and D would result in the splicing of two introns (non-coding regions of DNA). D might involve other regions of DNA that come with the introns (which might result in a frameshift mutation), hence why I thought A would be the best choice.

&amp;#x200B;

The IC50 of Curcumin to illicit a specific negative effect is 5-10 uM.

Curcumin has been shown to have a Cmax in serum of 0.18 ug/ml. Performing some quick molar calculations: 0.18 ug/ml \* 1mol/(308.33g) \* 1000ml/L = 0.584 umol/L = 0.5838 uM, assuming a molar mass of 308.33 for Curcuminoids. 

Hence in serum the concentration is 0.584 uM which is way below the IC50 of 5-10 uM so one should not worry about this specific negative effect.

It  asks if you have a protein that has maximal activity at pH of 8.3 and  we need to produce a buffer for the solution. What must be the ratio of  carbonic acid to bicarbonate in the **buffer** with Ka for carbonic acid = 7.9 x 10\^-7)

When  looking at the solution, I get how you use the Henderson-Hasselbach  equation and first convert Ka to pka which would be roughly 6.2 (pka = -  log(7.9x10\^-7). And then just solve for \[A\] for 10\^(8.3 - 6.2) = \[A-\],  if we assume \[HA\] = 1 to get a ratio of some number over 1. This roughly  translates to 1:158 ratio for acid to conjugate base. This part I get.

...

What  I don't get is, I thought buffers are best in a acid to conjugate base  ratio of 1:1, otherwise they wouldn't really work, since any slight  change in acidity/basicity would result in a change pH, which is what a  buffer is resisting (the whole point of a buffer). Since 1/158  &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; 1/1, wouldn't the ratio described above no longer be  considered a buffer (consider the half-equivalence point, where  \[HA\]=\[A\], which seems to make the question wrong, since it is asking for  what the buffer ratio would be, so the answer would the ratio of  conjugate base/acid, but the pair would not longer be considered a  buffer).

This is why I marked the  choice of a 1:1 ratio (I get that this would be addressing a different  pH), but would satisfy this definition of buffer.",Buffer Problem

Biochemistry,"Hi, I am stuck on a book enzyme problem I have been working on. Could someone help me out?

Here is the problem: Thymidylate synthase (TS) catalyzes the synthesis of deoxythymidine monophosphate (dTMP), an important nucleotide for DNA replication and repair. Yielding dihydrofolate (DHF) as a by-product via methyl donation from tetrahydrofolate (THF), TS couples with dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), which reduces DHF to THF. From the growth pattern of a bacterial mutant strain show in the figure below (+ indicates growth and ‚Äì indicates no growth), a researcher could reasonably conclude that the mutant has:

Mutant in minimum medium = -

Mutant in minimum medium + dTMP = +

Mutant in minimum medium + THF = +

Answer: Nonfunctional dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR)

My first question: How can the mutant grow in the Mutant in minimum medium + dTMP plate, if it lacks the THF (from a defective DHFR) needed to grow in it. If the answer is a nonfunctional dihydrofolate reductase, wouldn‚Äôt the plate pattern be the following:

Mutant in minimum medium = -

Mutant in minimum medium + dTMP = -

Mutant in minimum medium + THF = +

Here are the reaction steps I have gathered based on the text:

1)) (Reactant not stated in text) + TS -&gt; dTMP + (some intermediate that will form DHF when combined with the methyl group of THF)

2)) (some intermediate that will form DHF when combined with the methyl group of THF) + methyl group of THF - &gt; DHF

3)) DHF + DHFR - &gt; THF

Even if you produced dTMP, you would still need DHFR to produce the THF, which I assume is vital to survival, which is why based on those three reactions, the mutant SHOULD NOT grow on the dTMP plate (that does not include THF).

We're asked if we should expect the ""absorption"" of the different cell cultures (containing different sugars) before incubation to be the same (at a wavelength of 600nm). Upon further research I assumed they meant the OD600 instead of absorption. So I was wondering if the glucose / galactose added would scatter the light as well, influencing the initial readings. I would assume that it would not, since the lambda max of glucose is not near that range.

I have been reading this research study where they are investigating if QS can be manipulated with antagonists and agonists that are attached to a surface. They use QS output over Time to show if this QS system has been activated or inhibited. 

I was wondering, why would they use time to see the QS response rather than the concenetration or density of the agonist and antagonists tested? What would be the purpose or the bennefit of it? 

I think, that they use Time because the bacterial behaviours of this bacteria occur over a certein period of time and they do not depend so much on the density or the concentration of the agonists or antagonist. However, they do test if the desnity is a crucial factor for QS manipulation. Which is why I am conused.

Biochemistry,"So I am working on this assignment where I have to go out in nature, and take a photograph with e.g. my phone camera. Then, explain with the help of the picture how the concepts of cellular respiration, photosynthesis, and organic compounds are connected to each other. Using the picture, I should also be able to explain the carbon cycle. [Here's the image I took](https://imgur.com/a/xIdFovM), and below you will find my answer. Please help me by sharing your thoughts on how I should restructure my text, or if I should elaborate somewhere, etc. thank you in advance:

&gt;Organic compounds consist of molecules that have a carbon skeleton, that is, it has a chain of carbon atoms that form the basis of an organic molecule. Organic substances are high in energy, and some of them are used as fuels, e.g. substances contained in petrol. The molecules consist of carbon and hydrogen, and when these are combusted, during the formation of carbon dioxide, we have a reaction between the carbon atoms and oxygen. The hydrogen atoms in the molecules can also react with oxygen during combustion, and from this, water molecules are formed. Plants are made up of organic substances, and when they burn, carbon dioxide and water vapour are formed. The energy in these is converted into heat and light energy. Humans, and other living things, also consist of organic compounds, such as carbohydrates, protein, and fat. In order for the carbon atoms not to run out in nature, they must be reusable, which is why we have something called the carbon cycle. The cycle contains molecules from carbon dioxide and glucose. Plants can form glucose through photosynthesis, and the carbon atoms needed for glucose are derived from the carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere (air), which is an extremely small proportion, 0.039%.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;In addition to carbon dioxide, plants need water and energy to produce glucose. The plants convert light energy from the sun, or lamps, into the green substance chlorophyll that is found in the plants' leaves, as this is where light energy is collected. During photosynthesis, oxygen is formed, in addition to glucose, and released to the environment. The reaction of photosynthesis can most easily be described according to this formula: light energy + carbon dioxide + water ‚ü∂ glucose + oxygen. Six carbon molecules, and water molecules, together with light energy, gives us an excess of oxygen atoms, which is why oxygen is formed. Thus, the oxygen present in the atmosphere of the planet is formed by photosynthesis. At the same time as photosynthesis is driven by light energy, the energy released during cellular respiration is of a corresponding amount, and is converted into heat, which is then radiated from organisms. Energy has no reuse in a cycle, like carbon, because it radiates from organisms into space. This means that the sun has a great impact on the life that exists on our earth.  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;  
&gt;Glucose is simple sugars, monosaccharides, from which we can derive much of our energy. Us humans get our glucose, and other energy-rich nutrients, with the food that is eaten. Animals, as well as plants, go through a process called cellular respiration where glucose is used as fuel, and where carbon dioxide and water are formed. This is how carbon dioxide comes back into the atmosphere (air). Organic substances found in dead plants and animals are decomposed by decomposers (e.g. fungi and bacteria). But even decomposers have cellular respiration that helps the air get back carbon dioxide. It is worth noting that plants, and animals, that die in cold climates, or where there is a lack of oxygen, can make it difficult for decomposers to break them down. These plant and animal residues can be stored for a long time without being completely degraded. Over time, they instead become coal, oil or natural gas, i.e. fossil fuels, and may have been stored in the ground for millions of years. When we burn fossil fuels, carbon dioxide is released into the air, and so the cycle continues.

So in my high school level research on enzyme purification I came across a simple method of selectively narrowing down the amount of random protein in solution by using a heat solubility technique. In this technique, you would heat a given protein sample up until 5 to 10 C before the temperature where the protein of interest gets denatured. This denatures all undesirable proteins with denaturation temps lower than the desired enzyme‚Äôs. As these proteins unfold, they come out of solution and are insoluble. In order to quickly filter out the enzyme of interest and other dissolved proteins I planned on following up by centrifugation so that all of the insoluble proteins and other particles in solution collect at the bottom of the vessel as a pellet and the enzyme of interest is located in the supernatant (my enzyme is water soluble). If I‚Äôm doing this purely for removing insoluble proteins, does the x g matter? Our high school has a very old clunky centrifuge that when calculating max x g at its max rpm (1550), only gives 46 x g. Is this enough for effectively pellet-ing all of the insoluble material?

Biochemistry,"For example, in the urea cycle, argininosuccinate synthetase catalyses the reaction where citruline attacks the gamma phosphate of ATP to form an intermediate (Citrullyl-AMP). The AMP is a good leaving group and thus facilitates nucleophilic attack by the amine group of the incoming aspartate to form argininosuccinate. Why does citruline not attack the alpha phosphate of ATP to form Citrullyl phosphate. The phosphate group would also be an equally good leaving group. Seems to be uneconomical since the resulting AMP has to be restored with an ATPby adenylate kinase (ATP+AMP-&gt;2ADP)

Another example is carnitine acyltransferase where the carboxyl group of a fatty acid attacks the gamma phosphate of ATP to form fatty acyl-AMP. The AMP is then displaced by a CoA. Seems like a waste of ATP to me.

I've noticed a lot of COVID-19 deniers claim that the lab test is ""inaccurate"" or ""shouldn't be used for diagnoses"". I have a general understanding of this procedure and have used it in experiments but I wouldn't say I'm an expert and I definitely don't believe the deniers who don't even know what RT-qPCR is or stands for.

Anyways I was wondering how a false positive of using reverse transcriptase to convert viral mRNA to cDNA and then amplifying with fluorescently tagged forward and reverse primers could even generate a false positive? 

Is this a matter of non selective binding/amplification with the primers? Is the fragment being amplified, one that could easily be the same in a different virus or present in our own genome? Id really like to know about reasons why a professional might think this isn't an appropriate test for a diagnoses.

Can anyone recommend any studying tips to understanding biochemistry?

I tried to read the textbook (too dense and thick). I tried to go to office hours (the professor is a nice person but he really can't explain well). I tried to group study with my entire class (less than 10 people total and everyone seems to hate biochemistry - even those who have chemistry bachelors).

**What is also weird is that I have more chemistry classes than biology classes even though I was a biology major at an engineering school.**

Biology: Bio 1 and 2, Genetics, Physiology, Neuroscience, Tissue and Protein Engineering \*\^, Cell Biology 1 and 2, Biophysics, and Bioinformatics

\*\^ In Tissue and Protein Engineering class - I was okay with the molecular basis of tissues like ECM, epithelia, etc. It was only when we got to the protein part that discussed much organic chemistry that I was lost.

Chemistry: Gen chem 1 and 2, Orgo 1 and 2, Biochem 1 and 2, Computational Chemistry, Analytical Chemistry (lots of experimental techniques in Chemistry), Physical Chemistry.

Then my physics classes: I had quantum physics (which was basically like a theoretical chemistry class. We focused a lot on Hydrogen bonding, schrodinger equations) and Thermodynamics (which was Pchem on steroids with mathematics and physics).

I only got an A and enjoyed Pchem/thermodynamics. Every other chemistry class, I got a B or C in.

**So I had about 11 chemistry classes (both on the experimental and theoretical side) for my undergrad, and I had 10 biology classes even though I was a biology major.**

**Yet, I still do not understand or enjoy graduate level Biochemistry.**

**What is weird is that I understand molecular and cell biology which is like biochemistry's cousin.**

Example: For something like apoptosis, I can understand the molecular pathways leading to apoptosis. I know about the molecules - intrinsic pathway - Bcl2 releases cytochrome C which activates Apaf1 which binds to CARD which allows procaspases to form apoptosome leading to initiator caspase to activate executioner caspase which leads to CAD and DNA fragments.

***This idea of putting things into cascades is borrowed from chemistry.*** Yet when it's a chemical pathway or a cascade with proteins and chemical structures - I'm lost. \[**When it's an enzyme in a molecular biology class, I can understand**. When it's an enzyme or protein in chemistry/biochemistry, I don't understand it\].

Even when the topics overlap in molecular biology and biochemistry, I don't understand the biochemistry:

1. When we studied the cell cycle in depth with the Cdks (cyclin dependent kinases), I was able to understand it. When we learnt about which biological molecules activated replication, transcription, and translation, it was easy for me.
2. Then in biochemistry class, I was lost in Mg2+ ions making it more nucleophilic for dNTP. Which proteins and complexes were responsible for the initiation, elongation, termination and differences in translation/transcription in prokaryotes and eukaryotes \[this is ironic since it can be heavily studied in cell biology too\]. Yet I don't get it.

My cell biology and molecular biology classes are more engaging. We have 6 professors who do rotations and different lectures. They are usually 50 powerpoint slides.

In biochemistry, it's also the same format: 8 professors giving lectures in biochemistry. Except most of the lectures are 100 slides long. Each lecture all goes back to the initial lesson at the beginning. If it's a transcription lecture, every single pathway, cascade, etc will go back to transcription.

It's so confusing. No one in my class likes biochemistry. My class has 3 chemists and 4 biologist. Yet everyone hates biochemistry even though it's required for everyone. The exams are all tricky. Everyone loves cell biology even the chemistry masters and PhDs.

Biochemistry,"Hi guys, as the title suggest, in my current set of experiments, I am currently getting false positives in my negative controls.  


Normally, we would use the known RNA as positive control, and sub in water as the negative control. We have replaced all reagents, and still getting the same results which likely rules out contamination.   


Another bit of information which might also be relevant is that in our positive controls used to generate our standard curve, we are getting low level signals very early way before the expected Ct. The signal will appear in the first couple cycles (5-15ish, its very random), then suddenly it would disappear and then reappear closer to the expected Ct and form a smoothish fluorescent curve.

My friend and I began smoking cigarettes - Marlboro Reds - on the same night at a party in 2014 as teenagers. Within a fortnight he was smoking at least ten cigarettes a day and within a month he was smoking more than a pack (of 20) a day. When I spent time with him - which was every day for weeks - I would try to keep up with his rate of consumption, smoking maybe as many as ten cigarettes a day, a state which existed for approximately a month. We stopped spending time together then and my rate of consumption rapidly lowered to one or two a day, which in the next month or two declined further to what it still is now: between two and four cigarettes a week. Nowadays my friend however smokes 140-210 cigarettes a week.

It said that it has been previously found that during muscle contraction phosphorylase a is changed to b and that during recovery a is restored.
It also states that in another paper resting muscle was found to be in predominantly the b form.

I understand that resting muscle would be in the inactive b form, as high activity is not needed. However I don‚Äôt understand how there would then be enough a form to convert to b during muscle contraction.

Is a lot more of the a form produced just before contraction, maybe from the signalling of epinephrine? So that it can be used up/converted back to b during contraction?

When it says the a form is restored during recovery does that mean it is restored to the resting level which is much less than b? Then again more is made before contraction?

It took a while for me to get to this guess, and it kind of makes sense but I wanted to get clarification and make sure I‚Äôm thinking correctly.

My thought process so far is that I know in a beta-strand the sidechains will alternate on the top and bottom of each strand so if the Gly residue were to be interacting with any other residues in this chain, it would have to be with either Arg or Tyr. We were taught that the phenolic hydroxyl on Tyr can only except an H-bond from an amino group so I don't think Tyr could be the one interacting with the Gly residue. I think that Arg is more likely to be interacting with Gly so that is the residue I would change out with a non-polar a.a.

Biochemistry,"So, you might have seen I've posted a couple of questions about ion channels, action potentials and their dynamics.

I've particularly been wondering about voltage gated sodium channels and voltage gated calcium channels.

Specifically, how calcium effects voltage gated sodium channels and how magnesium effects both calcium and sodium channels?

So, some helpful people on here explained how calcium being a divalent cation, it binds to negative charges on the external membrane of a neuron and this alters the voltage at which sodium channels activate... Others stated that calcium binds to negative residues on the selectivity filter within the sodium ion channel and this causes a block in the pore with which sodium ions can not get through.

Similarly with Magnesium, some stated that being a divalent cation, it binds to negative charges on the external membrane of a neuron and this alters the voltage at which sodium and calcium channels activate.  Also, others stated that it binds to negative residues on the selectivity filter within both the NMDA receptor channel and voltage gated ion channel and this causes a block in the pore that prevents calcium from entering.

So my question is, which of these mechanisms or theories are correct? Are they both correct or no? Have any of these been proven or are they just hypotheses?",Ion channels question?

Biochemistry,"Hey everyone,

I just finished my first quarter of dental school, and I absolutely hated it. I was set on this profession since childhood as I have always loved making art, I love science, and my family dentist was definitely a role model to me. Yet, dental school is just a bunch of memorizing and regurgitating, and my school is brutal in terms of preclinic. I bombed one practical on a procedure rarely encountered in real dentistry, and I have to remediate the lab/got put on academic probation (most of my class failed that practical, and I'd say 60%+ of us have to make up for it now). It's not even our fault, it's because of COVID, we don't get enough lab time. Our school has a bad academic model anyway, last year 40% of first year students had to remediate lab after just one quarter, it's pretty ridiculous. Not to mention, I don't even like drilling, it's mindless work that anyone could be trained to do. 

Anyway, I have a strong background in biochemistry since I majored in the subject in college. I really loved physical biochemistry, specifically X-ray crystallography and how it can be used to solve protein structures/design drugs.

Biochemistry,"Hello, I'm an AP Biology teacher and once again starting into the bioenergetics unit. I'm tired of saying ""ATP hydrolysis releases free energy to do cellular mechanical, transport, chemical work.""  HOW?  I keep coming across the simplistic answer of the energy being stored in the 3rd bond of the last phosphate. So... is this the electrons that are highly charged?  the last phosphate? the repelling? ... and then which ever it is - how is this energy transferred?
I have ideas gleaned from trying to find information... 
1. The negatively unstable phosphate group ""pushes"" a molecule to react or move when released?
2. The unstable phosphate itself attaches to a substrate and maybe its electrons or something cause a conformational change that drives a reaction/motor proteins to try for a more stable state?
3. I found a diagram to support this next one, but I don't know if it's correct:   In coupled reactions, the phosphate is given to the substrate involved in the +g reaction which then is exchanged for another bond. But how could this work for mechanical or transport functions? I have stared long at the sliding filament theory's myosin heads and still don't see how this could work on the same principal.

Biochemistry,"27yo male here, who has recently damn near cured my PTSD with TRT (testosterone replacement therapy). I have had PTSD since early childhood due to trauma between the ages of 5-9. I'm here because I'm looking for more educated people then myself to help me figure this out, expand on and get this information to someone who can do more good with it. I stumbled upon testosterone after my doctor requested a 31 panel blood test and I came back all within rage. A healthy 27 year old. However, testosterone test wasn't included. After research I noticed a heavy correlation between the following: testosterone, cortisol, ptsd symptoms, estrogen, general mental illness symptoms, depression, teen depression, sleep disturbances, digestive issues, energy supplement use in those with anxiety disorders or mental illnesses, trauma vs hormones, CDC statistics, cortisol vs trauma, anxiety, irritability, mood (All I can remember off the top of my head). So after analyzing, I took a testosterone test on my own. It was 227ng/dl at 6:30 am after a full night of rest. I decided to go to a clinic and got tested 2 more times. #1- 270ng/dl and #2- 60ng/dl. Now before I continue you need to know at this time I was a ex smoker, worked out 3-6 days per week (including 3 primary muscle groups), ate primarily whole foods, limited sugar intake, and took vitamins including C, multi vitamin and Ashwagandha. You also need to know that when all those levels were tested I relatively felt the same as I've felt my whole life. (Never understood ""wait till you get older, you'll really feel bad"" considering I always felt shitty. At least it was consistent lol). I've also never had any ""major"" symptoms of low T or hypogonadism, yet again have felt the same my whole life. Anyways, after my second test (60ng/dl) I got my first testosterone shot (140mg cypionate I think) . After about 10 minutes I felt things I've never experienced in my whole life. Anxiety evaporated into a blissfullness that is near indescribable. My energy started to surge and I immediately understood what people meant to ""feel young again"". I had never felt this ""young"". Someone cut me off on the highway and I just smiled, feeling a sense of calm. Fog that seemed to surround my mind lifted and was presented with mental clarity never experienced. It fixed my depression, ptsd symptoms about 90% gone, depth of sleep, ability to sleep, positive overall mood improvement , irritability is gone, appetite has stabilized (always been severely underweight- lowest weight as adult was 125lbs at 6'2"", I've gained 10 healthy pounds in my first 4 weeks on therapy now weighing the most I've ever weighed 175lbs :)), high energy throughout the day without stimulants like caffeine or sugar. The experience was so profound (and still is) that over my first 4 days I periodically nearly broke out in tears of joy. A great sense of wellness everyday! I didn't know that this was how you were supposed to feel. I'm not exaggerating, just attempting to be as thorough as possible. And the best part? No side effects like pills doctors have pushed on me and others in the past. 

I just told my brother in law about it, who also has issues. He said sure, why not, getting tested wont hurt. He's 26 and his results today were 288ng/dl today.

&amp;#x200B;

**What's your analysis of the following comment?**

""As a brain scientist let me just say that most brain scientists don't know shit about alcoholism or addiction. They look at it from a strictly pharmacological perspective, seeing dependence and tolerance strictly in terms of receptor half-lives binding constants.

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor\_(biochemistry)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receptor_(biochemistry))

Yes, that plays a role, but it is actually a very minor part of recovery. Alcoholism is a thinking disorder whose major symptom is drinking. As long as drinking is maintained, then thinking cannot change. But remove alcohol, and underlying problems are exposed and can now be addressed. Early on I was discussing serenity prayer with my sponsor, and I asked what ""wisdom"" was, and he replied that it was "" ability to recognize a mistake as we are making it again."" What sobriety makes possible is opportunity to do things differently. We still make mistakes, but we start to stop them earlier in process.

Our alcoholic behavior is really just a set of established reflexes that respond to cues, so a big part of recovery is identifying those cues and then choosing a different pathway to avoid them. In recovery we have two opposing forces. bad one is biochemical and behavioral draw of alcohol and ""alcohol lifestyle."" To counter this we first remove alcohol, and then we alter lifestyle (not forever, but for at least as long as alcohol has its cunning, baffling, and powerful influence over our thinking processes) to one which is better. thing is, THIS is a daunting task. When we first look upon challenges ahead, we see them as being too great, and a return to bottle is just way easier and less painful. If we drank to reduce anxiety, this becomes really frustrating because anxiety is likely to go off scale when we stop drinking. But it does get better, and this is why I tell those new in recovery to be patient. Give it some time. challenge though becomes easier when we break it down into smaller units, which is point that these and all of other researchers seem to miss. We don't need to get completely better overnight. We can get just a little better each day, and slowly over time those days begin to add up.

I liken alcoholics to cats. bottle is our can opener, and we all know how long it takes a cat to stop reacting to can opener. We also know that second we give cat some food after using can opener, entire behavioral extinction process starts over on day 1. So it is with us drunks. We have these deeply ingrained synaptic pathways that have been reinforced daily for years. Unfortunately it takes a long time for them to disappear (or at least lose their strength) through disuse. This process can, however, be sped up a bit by simultaneously replacing them with new behaviors or activities. wisdom of AA is that pretty much every strategy to do this has been tried and tested. For those who started to drink right after work, solution was often going straight to a meeting and not to bar. We all have needs that need to be met, and one of those is companionship. If we go home rather than bar, we have removed alcohol from equation, but at same time we have also lost our source for companionship. Successful recovery doesn't come just from removing alcohol, it comes from replacing alcohol with a better strategy to fulfill need that alcohol was providing. So a meeting acts to provide companionship but in an alcohol-free environment. And it is hard to think about drinking if you are distracted by actually doing something else.

If alcohol is removed, physical pathology will likely reverse over same time course because for most part it is simply a biochemical process. That is what scientists are measuring. What ODAT approach gives, though, is a means by which one can maintain motivation to keep going. AA doesn't say go to 90 meetings, it suggests 90 meetings in 90 days. Going to 90 meetings in 10 days doesn't provide that much more benefit. It is 90 days that matters, and staying motivated to do 90 days. Probably half of posts here are about problems with motivation to keep going. So listen to those with time who say it is worth effort, because they are proof that it can be overcome. Stopping drinking is actually easy. But stopping drinking and not going bat-shit nutz is a bigger challenge. All of scientists, and most of doctors, that I have worked with over years see addiction problem purely as a pharmacological model. What they are looking at, though, is really de-tox problem. Once receptors have been stabilized back to baseline, which is rarely more than 30 days max, depending on regeneration half-life, their contribution is over. That 28 day treatment model isn't just a coincidental number. But those of us in recovery know that 30 days is just beginning of interesting part, where thinking needs to change.""","""One day at a time"" is a mantra for recovering alcoholics, for whom each day without a drink builds strength to go on to next.

The kit we use is XABT nucleic acid extraction. The kit can do 50 tests. 

There were different ways people do the reagent preparation. 

&amp;#x200B;

One method was to prepare it per batch. That colleague would open one kit/box then make a batch of lysis buffers for the whole batch of 50 tests. He would add lysis buffers + proteinase k + carrier RNA. Then aliquot for the 50 tests into 50 eppendorf tubes. 

Another colleague aliquots lysis buffer + proteinase k, for 50 tests. He reconstitutes the carrier RNA but doesnt add it yet. Only when he would do the extraction, would he add carrier RNA  and only on the number of samples to be tested. He would leave the cRNA in the ultra-low freezer (as per instructions of the kit). His concern was that carrier RNA might deteriorate over time if already added to the lysis buffers. 

But for me, dethawing and thawing the cRNA again and again might rapidly destroy it. I prefer the batch method of the first colleague explained here. In a week, we do an average of 60 tests of xABT manual extraction.

Biochemistry,"Hello Reddit

So I‚Äôm trying to understand how the enzyme is separated and put into the solid phase. From the youtube videos I have seen and literature I have read, it appears that the specific molecule that the enzyme is supposed to catalyze is chemically bonded to an agarose bead, and when the crude solution passes through the column, the enzyme is immobilized by getting caught on the the agarose connected substrate molecule. So, for example, if I wanted to purify nitrate reductase, I would need to find a way to bond a NO3 group to the agarose bead, and then pass the raw solution through the column, and then get rid of waste and then pass a nitrate saturated solution through the column to compete with the bead groups to extract the enzyme from the beads?

I'm stuck because on one hand, I thought the folded, flexible protein is more favorable because folding reduces nonpolar regions exposed to polar regions.

Biochemistry,"Hey all, 

&amp;#x200B;

I am a recent grad out the State University of NY at Cortland with a B.S. in Biochemistry (Magna Cum Laude, for what its worth) so I have come here for some advice/assistance. I'll add on-- I am in New York as well, if the school did not make that clear. 

I know I should not be picky with where my first job is, but I kind of have my heart set on Colorado (yes, anywhere basically there) because of the mountain culture and the mountains themselves; on top of which, I have an uncle in Aurora so I can start work immediately. 

I have run into the issue of applying to over 40 lab positions in Biotech, Healthcare and research assistant positions at CU in Boulder. I have a whopping 5 responses back, each saying no with their own twist of words. Furthermore, I have even gone to the extent of applying to extraction positions in cannabis labs, which I honestly would enjoy, and brewery tech positions, positions I am overqualified for, with no luck. I do not have experience outside of academia, so I am assuming that is the issue. 

I am suspecting I will see the same trend in most any other place I apply, so before I do, I would like to ask some sort of advice. I have overhauled my resume so that it is very easy on the eyes, takes up the page and highlights my proficiencies, along with writing cover letters for each that directly relate to the job.  I have reached out to a number of recruiters on LinkedIn, with premium, and no responses. I have also done my best to make my LinkedIn profile appealing. 

I have noticed most jobs I have applied to are saturated with 15+ applications, as well. Since it is my first job, I am in no way expecting to make more than 40k, which is fine I will work my way up or go back to school. 

&amp;#x200B;

So, the beckoning question is, what can I do to further increase my chances? I am in the mindset that I'm not doing anything wrong, but instead I am not doing something I should be doing to increase my chances? 

Furthermore, is this the wrong state for a Biochem degree? 

also, quick side note. Why do entry level jobs look for work experience? Does that not defeat the purpose of entry level?

I will be streaming on thursday mornings at 10:30 est for my organic lab class, and Tuesday evenings I will be streaming an organic chemistry 2 recitation lecture. Once I am done with organic chemistry I will rotate to biochemistry, or if demand is high enough I can stream a third day for biochemistry.

Biochemistry,"It's my first post here, I'm not sure this is the place to ask, but I've run into a wall trying to find resources myself - any input is appreciated. I haven't been able to find much literature related to this specific question. 

In a muscle sample, what upstream or adjacent factors may cause reduced CS activity, and in turn, what is the downstream impact of reduced CS activity?  I understand extent/how reduced matters here, and the best estimate is less than 60% of predicted activity compared to matched controls.

""Upstream"" factors impacting CS would be pyruvate, pyruvate carboxylase, oxaloacetate, and acetyl-CoA activity/ availability (based on direct players I can readily identify). The phenotype associated with this sample of reduced CS activity in muscle is puzzling, and certainly not severe enough or with enough other obvious metabolic perturbations to be associated with a canonical pyruvate carboxylase deficiency, etc. Genetic sequencing has not revealed a candidate variant in a host of TCA cycle players so far.

I'm stuck trying to figure out which of the remaining 5 encode a metabolically relevant protein. According to the chart/figures in ensembl, all 5 of them have the regions needed to code for the proline dehydrogenase.

Biochemistry,"The title may be a bit confusing so let me elaborate. I am attempting to quantify protein-protein interactions between homologs of different species using BLI with streptavidin sensors (biotinylated and immobilized bait titrated with prey). It looks something similar to this:



Zebrafish A -&gt; Zebrafish B
Mouse A -&gt; Mouse B
Human A -&gt; Human B



I have structures of each of these complexes (Zebrafish A:B, Mouse A:B, Human A:B) with good resolution and the interfaces are almost identical. We have in vivo validation that these interactions are real. Using ChimeraX as well as qtPISA (as implemented in the CCP4 suite) I can see that the salt bridges/number and type of hydrogen bonds are identical. 



Unfortunately, Kds are significantly different. These are rapid interactions (Koffs are at or beyond what the instrument can accurately measure) and my results vary between 200nM to 100uM. This is seen between different pairs and is consistent with biological replicates and by switching immobilized and titrated protein. For example:



 Zebrafish A:B = 100uM from 3 biological replicates, same Kd if I biotinylate A and run with B, or biotinylate B and run with A. 
Human A:B = 200nM from 3 biological replicates, same Kd if I biotinylate A and run with B, or biotinylate B and run with A.



I really don‚Äôt know how to explain these differences save for aggregation. Aggregation has been a serious issue throughout the process, with some protein preps aggregating at 25C after ten minutes or upon certain concentrations which ruin BLI runs for that day. Measuring kinetics with concentrated proteins that are several days old can give Kds that are sometimes 10X worse. I have spent significant time optimizing biotinylation and differing detergents to no avail, these values are still different. 



My PI waxes between no to moderate concern and contends that we are dealing with domains of poorly behaved proteins that are challenging to purify. My PI also says we set about doing one thing, validating the interface with a second goal of attempting to quantify these interactions; so we partly succeeded. My other committee members/biochemists in the department either don‚Äôt know BLI or don‚Äôt seem that bothered. I have seen worse data written and published, but as I write this manuscript I feel as though a reviewer will tear at us with this problem, ‚Äúyour interfaces are nearly identical yet your Kds are so different, please do another year of experiments‚Äù. Unfortunately I have no time left in my degree to complete another set of BLI (previous experiments took over a year and a half with most weekends spent working). 

My questions are the following: 
1.	What could I have done differently to quantify these interactions (apart from SPR which I think would have run into the same issue)? Would AUC have worked?



2.	How do investigators normally attempt to quantify PPIs with such poorly behaved, aggregation prone proteins?



3.	Has anyone ever encountered this problem and dealt with reviewer response?",Quantifying PPIs with aggregation prone proteins

Biochemistry,"""Everybody knows"" that
1. Molecules of saturated fatty acids (SFAs) and ''trans''-unsaturated fatty acids (TUFAs) are straight zig-zags, while those of '''cis''-unsaturated fatty acids (CUFAs) have a conspicuous ~120 degree bend  at each double bond.
2. Because of ""fact"" 1, SFAs and TUFAs can pack more densely in the solid state than CUFAs.
3. ""Fact"" 2 is the reason why the MP of an SFA  or TUFA is generally higher than that of a CUFA with same chain size.  
4. Saturated fats"" are usually solid while unsaturated fats are usually liquid.
5. ""Fact"" 1 is the ultimate reason for ""fact"" 4.

These ""facts"" seem to be widely believed by nutritionists and ""health food"" fans and peddlers.  But are they true, really?  

Most chemists seem to be aware that all fatty acid molecules can assume many different shapes, because any two parts of the chain  that are connected by a single bond can rotate about that bond with relatively small energy barriers.  So, I would expect that any fatty acid will mostly assume a randomly crumpled shape in the liquid phase, in solution, or in any complex solid mixture.  

In fact, I would expect SFAs to be **more** crumpled than TUFAs or CUFAs in those conditions, because they are **more**  flexible.

So, I am looking for an *authoritative* source that would confirm or refute those ""facts"" -- not by just stating them, but by pointing to experimental determinations of the shapes of fatty acid and/or triglyceride molecules in their fluid phases and/or in solution and/or in mixed solids.  

No luck yet.  Could  someone here help, please?

Meanwhile, let me offer, not one, but **two** explanations for the melting point difference, instead of ""fact"" 2, that are based on the negation of ""fact"" 1 -- namely, based on the counter-claim that ""SFAs are more flexible and normally assume a more crumpled shape than UFAs"":

H1. Since an SFA molecule is more flexible, it can more easily twist or straighten so as to fit into the optimum place in a growing crystal. Hence it starts to crystallize at a higher temperature.

H2. Since an SFA molecule is more flexible, even in the solid state it has more low-energy vibrations modes (that involve simultaneous rotation about two or more single bonds).  Thus an SFA can still vibrate in place in a crystal at a temperature that would cause the more rigid UFAs to shake loose.

I don't put much faith in either of these theories, though.  The point is just to show that there are alternatives to the explanation that ""everybody knows"", so its intuitive appeal is not enough.",Shape of fatty acid and triglyceride molecules

Will those acids get elongated in the human body to C16:0, C18:0, and so on?  Would the Delta-9 desaturase (D9D) enzyme turn lauric acid into a C12:1 omega-3 UFA?  

I suppose that if the diet has high fat contents, the D9D and similar pathways get overwhelmed, and most of the fat will be burned for energy.

3. Add primary antibody which binds an epitope on the protein and a fluorophore-labeled secondary antibody which binds the primary antibody.
4. Visualize

My question - how is the primary antibody able to bind its epitope if the protein was denatured on the gel? My understanding of antibodies is that the Fab region recognizes the specific 3D structure of the epitope.

Hello everyone. Thank you to everyone who responded to [this post](https://np.reddit.com/r/Biochemistry/comments/hr7hpy/i_am_having_some_difficulty_using_electricity_to/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) about some of the issues I was having inducing muscle contraction in vitro. 

I looked more into the conditions under which I was testing the muscle and I saw multiple errors that I made which I intend to fix:

-	stretching the muscle &amp; applying tension
-	isolating thinner sections along length of sarcomeres
-	storing it in chilled saline solution
-	using lower frequency, closer to published conditions (~60 Hz)
-	acquiring the skeletal muscle before post-processing that renders tissue dead; i found outthe animal had been electrocuted and scalded before i got it last time so it clearly must have been dead

I have some more questions about contractile function of skeletal muscle. 

First off, how long will the muscle retain its contractile function after being removed from the animal? I am going to test it at the slaughterhouse as soon as I get it. Will it still retain its ability to contract once I bring it all the way back home? I am going to store it in a chilled saline solution. How long after that will it retain its function (aka how many days)?

This time I‚Äôm getting the skeletal muscle from a halal slaughterhouse. The animal is killed humanely according to USDA regulations. It is stunned (not electrocuted, just rendered unconscious) and then they cut the throat off and it bleeds out. Will the muscle still be functional? None of the post processing should affect the muscles function in this case. 

Second, regarding how much electricity I am going to apply to the muscle - in the study I saw regarding conduction of current through the body, it said that 6-24mA at 60Hz induced maximum tetanic contraction in the body and that anything higher could cause paralysis and permanent damage.

I looked more into the conditions under which I was testing the muscle and I saw multiple errors that I made which I intend to fix:

-	stretching the muscle &amp; applying tension
-	isolating thinner sections along length of sarcomeres
-	storing it in chilled saline solution
-	using lower frequency, closer to published conditions (~60 Hz)
-	acquiring the skeletal muscle before post-processing that renders tissue dead; i found outthe animal had been electrocuted and scalded before i got it last time so it clearly must have been dead

I have some more questions about contractile function of skeletal muscle. 

First off, how long will the muscle retain its contractile function after being removed from the animal? I am going to test it at the slaughterhouse as soon as I get it. Will it still retain its ability to contract once I bring it all the way back home? I am going to store it in a chilled saline solution. How long after that will it retain its function (aka how many days)?

Second, regarding how much electricity I am going to apply to the muscle - in the study I saw regarding conduction of current through the body, it said that 6-24mA at 60Hz induced maximum tetanic contraction in the body and that anything higher could cause paralysis and permanent damage. It also said that less than 6V was needed for max contractile force.

Hey all! I've recently started a YouTube series aiming to teach biology/biochemistry in an intuitive way (less memorization, more conceptual understanding). My vision for the series is not to give students the information they need to pass their exams but to instead develop a ""feeling"" or ""intuition"" for bio, which many students often lack because they end up just cramming hundreds of vocab words a night. This series isn't intended to be a replacement for an actual biology class but to instead build a foundation for viewers to better appreciate the key concepts of the subject and be excited to learn more. I've only just started this series and it'll definitely be a few months until it's complete, but I think it'd be useful for *anyone* trying to start learning biology or biochemistry in any form!

Biochemistry,"I am having some difficulty using electricity to induce skeletal muscle contraction in vitro

I am working on a project that involves acquiring isolated skeletal muscle and inducing contraction using an electrical current. I am going to then measure the force produced by said skeletal muscle.

In Luigi Galvani‚Äôs famous experiments, he took a freshly dead frog, dissected the legs keeping the sciatic nerve intact, and transferred an electric current to the leg, which moved as though it was alive. It has been replicated tons of times since then and now is a standard high school experiment.

I have been in touch with people who work at the slaughterhouse/meat lab at my university. Today, I went there and got a sample of skeletal muscle. I put it in chilled solution promptly to preserve its action potential and contractile function. 

I hooked up the muscle to the circuit. When I pressed the pedal to apply more voltage, the LED in series with the muscle got brighter (indicating that current was flowing through the muscle and that it increased when the pedal was pressed). However, the muscle did not contract at all. 

[Vid of my unsuccessful attempt :(](https://youtu.be/3NrLczzISzI)

I am starting to get a little worried. Why isn‚Äôt it working? The voltage applied ranges from 0.9V-4.5V at 16MHz.

Biochemistry,"Hi everyone, thanks for looking at this question !!

So basically my question is this : 

In complex I of the ETC (NADH dehydrogenase) NADH gives off a hydride ion (:H-) as a source of 2 electrons which is taken by the prosthetic group FMN. Then FMN takes an H+ ion from the matrix (?) and is reduced to FMNH2. The 2 electrons then find their way to Ubiquinone through a series of Fe-S centers.

The Ubiquinone presumably takes 2 H+ ions from the matrix (?) to get reduced to Ubiquinol (QH2). What happens to the 2 H+ ions that are left behind on FMN after the 2 electrons are detached ? Are those the same protons that are taken by Q ? If so, are these protons thrown to the matrix from the FMN to later be taken by the Q or is there an intramolecular route by which they combine with Q ?

A similar problem happens with the Complex II (Succinate dehydrogenase) where I don't understand what happens to the 2 H+ ions left behind after FADH2 donates its 2 electrons.

Hope I was able to explain the problem. Please leave an explanation if you happen to have one.

What causes bonds to shift and react within the body? How are we able to break Œ±-linkages but not Œ≤-linkages of certain polysaccharides? And the reasons as to why these all happen^^.

However, I‚Äôve been more interested in the bonding that occurs and am very eager to learn Ochem for that reason, but aren‚Äôt sure on whether to pursue Chem or Biochem.

Biochemistry,"Hey lab people. I'm working with a GST-tagged protein with a thrombin cleavage site. So naturally I use thrombin to cut the GST from my protein in purification.

However, I observe a gel band of ~12 kDa that I would not expect (not GST, thrombin, or my protein), which even appears to elute in the same region as my protein in size exclusion chromatography and is not present before the thrombin cleavage step. This was present in two separate preps, so it's likely not just a contaminant.

I am a current 11th grade student from New York and I am in the second year of my school‚Äôs science research program. Over the past two years, I have reviewed extensive research done mostly in the fields of biology, chemistry, medicine and health (with an emphasis on cancer and neuroscience), and some social sciences like psychology and economics. 

As part of the program, students are required to work with a mentor to assist in research that will ultimately be put into a variety of formats for presentation at science competitions. While this research is traditionally done over the summer, because of the virus there has unsurprisingly  been an impact in scheduling and lab accessibility. Originally, I was supposed to work with a cancer researcher who, among many of his achievements, recently worked on a study detailing the immune landscape of cancer as well as a project for an early detection diagnostic tool for gynecological cancers. However, because of the outbreak he does not have time for an intern as he has turned his lab‚Äôs research towards vaccine efforts. 

Though I know reddit may be an unconventional place for such a request, if any researcher has an interest in mentoring a high school student, I would love the opportunity to work and communicate electronically, or in-person if feasible, throughout the summer! Also, if you are interested but want more information about me and/or my background in research/science, I can send you my r√©sum√©, a letter describing mentor responsibilities, references, and any other information that you might be interested.

Ques:  Osmotic Balance in a Marine Frog The crab-eating frog of Southeast Asia, Rana cancrivora, develops and matures in freshwater but searches for its food in coastal mangrove swamps (composed of 80% to full-strength seawater) When the frog moves from its freshwater home to seawater it experiences a large change in the osmolarity of its environment (from hypotonic to hypertonic) 

(a) Eighty percent seawater contains 460 mM NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM CaCl2, and 50 mM MgCl2. What are the concentrations of the various ionic species in this seawater? As summing that these salts account for nearly all the solutes in seawater, calculate the osmolarity of the seawater. 

(b) Like all frogs, the crab-eating frog can exchange gases through its permeable skin, allowing it to stay underwater for long periods of time without breathing. How does the high permeability of frog skin affect the frog's cells when it moves from fresh water to seawater?

  
(c) The crab-eating frog uses two mechanisms to maintain its cells in osmotic balance with its environment. First, it allows the Na+Na+ and Cl‚àíCl‚àí concentrations in its cells to in crease slowly as the ions diffuse down their concentration gradients. Second, like many elasmobranchs (sharks), it retains the waste product urea in its cells. The addition of both NaCl and urea increases the osmolarity of the cytosol to a level nearly equal to that of the surrounding environment.

Assuming the volume of water in a typical frog is 100mL100mL, calculate how many grams of NaCl (formula weight (FW) 58.44 ) the frog must take up to make its tissues isotonic with seawater.  
(d) How many grams of urea (FW 60) must it retain to accomplish the same thing?",Need help in a question.

Biochemistry,"I've recently been working on a bioinformatics project, and part of my job is to retrieve information about specific proteins and the genes that encode them (these proteins are from two different species of bacteria). I'm using SnapGene to view GenBank files that contain genome sequences for each of these bacterial species, and I've noticed that directionality has been specified for each gene (i.e. forward/reverse) to indicate the strand on which the gene is found in the genome.

I understand that, by convention, the ""forward strand"" appears as 5'-&gt;3' (with 5' on the left and 3' on the right) and the ""reverse strand"" appears as 3'-&gt;5' (with 3' on the left and 5' on the right) in a double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) molecule. However, I don't understand how this notation is kept consistent across different databases and different species. **What prevents either strand from being viewed as the ""forward"" strand by different people?** (i.e. in the same way that either strand can be the ""coding"" or ""template"" strand, depending on the strand being transcribed).

Since each complementary, antiparallel strand in a dsDNA molecule technically runs from 5'-&gt;3' (especially when you can just change the physical orientation of the molecule so that either strand has its 5' end is on the ""left""), **what criteria is used to permanently designate one strand, but** **not the other, as ""forward""?**

I've been searching through university notes, multiple biochemistry/cell biology/genetics textbooks and academic literature, and I haven't found a satisfying answer--I would be incredibly grateful towards those who can provide clarification for me on this topic!

NOTES:

* I've seen some people on other online forums claim that the ""forward"" strand has its 5' end at the end of the short arm in a Eukaryotic chromosome, but \[A\] I don't believe this applies to bacteria and \[B\] I don't know enough about the orientation of DNA in chromosomes to verify this.
* Furthermore, I've seen others claim that the assignment of ""forward/reverse"" is arbitrary. I currently don't think this is true, based on my understanding of[ Illumina's sequencing by synthesis](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCd6B5HRaZ8) procedure, which depends on being able to consistently differentiate between DNA fragments with different directionalities.
* I've also seen people claim that, for bacteria, directionality comes from the direction of replication, but this doesn't make sense to me based on my understanding of the[ bi-directional nature](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmWuju1S9_E) of bacterial replication.","If both strands of DNA in a double-stranded molecule begin at their 5' end and terminate at their 3' end, why is only one strand designated as the ""forward"" strand?

I am on the verge of failing my second semester of physical chemistry, I have had average scores but had technical difficulty with a remote exam and my grade was destroyed because of it (I have tried to appeal this but it is out of my hands now). I can likely pull off a c-, however I am currently at about an overall 3.0 GPA and it has been a arduous time getting it there (I am not an academic, and much prefer the lab), but has been trending up.

Which gives:

dP(n)/dt = b * (n-1)P(n-1) + d * (n+1)P(n+1) - bnP(n) - dnP(n)

So you look at what happens in each state. In state P(n-1) you can have a birth, and each (n-1) can produce, at state P(n+1) you can have a death and each n+1 out of those can die. In state P(n) then you can have a birth or a death.

Biochemistry," 

My academic interests hover somewhere between the biochemistry side of things, and bioinformatics. I've felt that genetic engineering is the way of the future, and wanted to help contribute research towards that in order to grow the collective pool of knowledge at humanities disposal. 

I recently finished my AA and got back all my college decisions. I got into some solid biology programs, and was planning on doing UF online before transferring to University of Maryland to dual major in biochem and bioinformatics. This was until I got a very late decision from George Washington University. GW was more of a tertiary school I applied to on a whim. I didn't put much thought into the specific program I was applying to because I doubted I would be able to afford that university. To my surprise though, they gave me basically a full ride scholarship. The complicating factor is, I applied to the biomedical engineering in the college of engineering. Theoretically I could try and change my college at GW, but a big chunk of my finical aid seems tied to the college of engineering. 

So I'm at a bit of an impasse. Biomedical engineering is a cool field, but it's not as closely tied to my interests in genetic engineering. Is it worth changing the focus of my undergrad in order to go to a much impressive university? What are the career prospects of biomed engineers compared to someone in the field I was intending to do into?","Just had a really good opportunity to get a full ride of George Washington University, but it may require me to change majors from biochem to biomedical engineering.

Biochemistry,"I think I'll do much better in the biology major because I'd only have to take one chemistry class: Organic Chemistry. That pretty much means further study to get a decent paying job (Optometry, Podiatry, Graduate Level Studies in Biology/Molecular Biology, or an MBA). With Biotechnology though, I think I'd have more luck getting a job right out of school, but will need to progress to a Ph.D at some point.

The only real difference is that the biotechnology major has the option of taking either two semesters of organic chemistry or two semesters of biochemistry (versus just one organic chemistry class for biology)? There's also more classes that deal with genetics and genetics and evolution (Molecular Genetics etc...).

Tell me, if I have no real aptitude for Chemistry, trouble concentrating for long periods of time outside of my narrow interests, and no drive to learn about Chemistry in my day to day life am I making a huge mistake by picking Biotechnology as my major?

I'm wondering if there are others like me on here, perhaps further along than me, who have some words of wisdom to share. I love biochemistry, but like many, I did not love academia, nor my lab/PI. Two years into my program, it started to really sink in that I didn't love my project or my PI, that I'd likely be looking at a 6- or 7-year PhD, plus a postdoc and poor employment prospects after that. I started to question the pragmatism of staying in the program. Most of my friends weren't in academia, and I think it helped to see things from their perspective, outside the bubble. It just didn't add up, so I swallowed my pride and wrote up a Master's thesis. 

The trouble is, even though I stand by the decision, I know I still have a chip on my shoulder about it. I still love biochemistry. It just sucks that if things had gone a bit differently -- if my postdoc mentor hadn't left out of the blue, if I'd been there six months earlier and gotten on that more interesting project, if my PI liked me more -- things might have gone differently. Anyone else struggling with similar thoughts? 

At this point, I'm not sure what my career options are with an MS in biochem. Seems like the common options are: teaching high school or if I'm lucky, community college, or lab manager/tech work at a university lab or industry. I'm not interested in pharma or business. At this point, I'm thinking I'm better off taking the loss and starting over from scratch (currently thinking about doing a coding bootcamp). I'm basically soliciting solidarity here.

Biochemistry,"I'm a grad student, first year. So I'm trying to plan for some fluorescence and/or ITC studies but I'm having some troubles calculating molecular weight. Let's take this molecule of K63-linked di-ubiquitin, for example.

I can just copy and paste the ubiquitin chain into the ExPASy ProtParam tool twice, but that won't really be atomically correct because there are intricacies at the Lysine-Glycine linkage between the two chains that don't necessarily correspond to the plain amino acid sequence.

So I thought I'd just use the ""compute with missing hydrogens"" function on PyMOL for the structure I'm interested in. I made sure to highlight only the amino acids I was interested in, and not any waters or other random crystal structure molecules.

HOWEVER, I've found that there is some serious disparity between the ExPASy-calculated molecular weight and the PyMOL-calculated molecular weight. ExPASy gave me 17111.67 g/mol for two ubiquitin chains, and PyMOL gave me 17390.84 g/mol for the diubiquitin structure, even without a glycine residue that wasn't well-resolved (which, if included, would only raise the molecular weight computed).

To be clear, the intricacies at the Lysine-Glycine linkage aren't large enough to cause a disparity of a couple hundred g/mol - maybe a couple of g/mol at most. And if I do the ""compute explicit"" in PyMOL, the molecular weight is only 16099.66 g/mol, so that isn't it either.

So my question is: Can I trust the PyMOL calculated value if I manually add the extra glycine back into the calculation? Why is it so far off from ExPASy? I figured it would be very close since it calculated it based off of atoms present.

Anny feedback is appreciated.",PyMOL/ExPASy ProtParam Molecular Weight Disparity

Biochemistry,"Hi! I was talking with my PhD supervisor earlier and she mentioned she had some pathogen effectors that were known to localise to a particular part of chloroplasts where I am looking at certain protein formation processes. Anyway she said I could use the effectors (which interact with my protein of interest) as a technique to work out more about the process I'm looking at and find other proteins involved or more about my protein.

I've not used effectors in this way before and haven't heard of anyone using effectors like this (i.e. as a tool for protein discovery *outside* of an infection context). Does anyone know of examples of where effectors have been used like this?

I need some advice. I completed an undergraduate research project this semester, and had to create a research poster to present. I just finished presenting it to a group of about 20 people who are all highly educated either with their PhD or Masters, or currently attending graduate school. I completed the study with a graduate student, but unfortunately she was not able to attend the presentation to help answer questions. On the poster, I included graphs that the graduate student had created with the data. Some of the graphs are ones I have never seen before and did not know how they were created or the deep meaning. At the end of the presentation, I was asked questions about them that I did not really know how to answer without the help of the graduate student. I just feel immensely embarrassed to not have been able to answer, and honestly inadequate. I tried to come up with some reasoning, but felt like I sounded really dumb. I am about to graduate in two weeks, and I could not adequately answer questions about graphs.

Biochemistry,"This is for an assignment. We are given some cases where the patients present with varying liver test results. This is a little something extra I added in regarding the usefulness of AST/ALT ratios:

""The issue with AST/ALT-ratios is that they aren‚Äôt applicable for diagnostic assessment alone, serving more as an indicative cue for reasoning potential causative physiological issues, prompting further investigative testing in that area. And unless values are greatly skewed (x2 ULN), it becomes less utilisable as a lab value. This is because AST/ALT values not only fluctuate between individuals, but also within said individual throughout the day, (depending on lifestyle/daily-routine, e.g. strenuous exercise increases AST). 
The magnitudes of AST, ALT elevations will depend upon the extent and cause of specific tissue damage (ALT=hepatocellular damage), and although a broad generalisation, its worth noting that if ischemic damage was inflicted upon a healthy liver and a cirrhotic liver, that the healthy liver may have hugely elevated AST or ALT values, whilst a cirrhotic liver, (where normal parenchyma has already been replaced by scar-tissue, and thus lost function), may only get a minimal elevation in comparison.
However, AST/ALT levels still confined within their respective reference-ranges may still provide an indication of what is happening in the liver and provide differentiate insight between causes of liver damage or hepatotoxicity.

Therefore, because there is a 1:1 AST/ALT-ratio which is indicative of a hepatocellular abnormality in relation to acute-viral-hepatitis/drug-related-toxicity, this would prompt further testing in the forms of hepatitis screening, as well as a comprehensive drug panel and further questioning the patient on potential drug/alcohol intake. We would also refer to clinical-biochemistry-data in the form of imaging and fine-needle-biopsy 
Furthermore, based that AST, ALT values are still confined within specified reference-ranges it would signal that any ‚Äúpotential‚Äù damage is not acute but leans more towards chronic.""","I wrote a paragraph regarding AST/ALT-ratios, and their usefulness when lab values are still below the upper-limit-of-normal.

Greetings fellow biochemist,

As I was studying I came to a road block: ""How are histones basic and have a positive charge""?  and      ""Is the charge of the histone important for histone modification""? I was perplexed and  my world was slowly coming to an end (Not Really). However, I did some digging and I think I found the answer to my questions.  Now I want to hear what you guys think about my answer and maybe some of you have similar questions, 

The Histone proteins H4, H2B, H2A, and H3 are basic and consist primarily of arginine, histidine and lysine ( the Basic Amino Acids). Bases are generally negatively charged and acids are generally positively charged however basic amino acids and acidic amino acids are different from the typical acid and base.

Why are they different? Every amino acid has an acidic group, a basic group, and a R group thus one amino acid molecule can have multiple charges based on the environment. The pH environment plays a significant role on the charge of a particular amino acid. An acidic amino acids likes to be a zwitterion in acidic conditions, a neutral amino acid likes to be a zwitterion in a neutral pH conditions and a basic amino acid likes to be a zwitterion in basic conditions. This is where our knowledge of pkas and titrations come in. Acidic amino acids are negative in neutral pH conditions and basic amino acids are positive in neutral pH conditions. 

Below is the titration curve of arginine and as you can see, arginine has a positive charge in neutral pH conditions.

https://preview.redd.it/ynb5pusia8u41.png?width=402&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=429cb9b5bb43e4aa17e369167f2161c17f8b738d

We found the answer! Even though histones are basic, the pH of the nucleus ranges from 6 to 8. Therefore, all of the basic amino acids will have a +1 charge in the nucleus ( At homeostasis) . Because histones are primarily composed of basic amino acids, the charge of the histone will be positive in the nucleus. This is important because DNA is negative and the positive charge of the histones create an attractive bond between the DNA and the histones thus making DNA coil around the histones.

The positive charge on the histones are imperative to the process of gene regulation by histone modification: Transferase enzymes in the nucleus manipulate the charges on the amino acids of the histone proteins by adding a functional group to the histones. For example, lets imagine that we are histone methyltransferase and we methylate (tag with -CH3) the positively charged nitrogen's on the basic amino acids of the histones. This would decrease the positive charge on the histones thus increasing negative charge. If our methylation creates a negative charge on the histone then this would create a kinetic force repelling the new negatively charged histone and the negatively charged DNA molecule (Coulombs Law). This allows space for transcription factors to bind to the promoter region and start transcription. Congrats, we just activated gene expression of a gene via histone modification. Now lets take the methyl groups off of the basic amino acids of the histone protein or demethylate it.  The histone will revert back to a positive charge, creating an attractive force between the histone and DNA, closing the space for transcription factors to bind to the promoter region. Congrats we have just repressed  gene expression!

Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication thus I shall explain this in even shorter terms. Histone modification is a type of nuclear gene expression and involves enzymes adding and removing functional groups in order to change the net charge of the histone proteins.

If DNA is negative and Histone is positive = Heterochromatin = no gene transcription

If DNA is negative and Histone is negative= Euchromatin= gene transcription

Biochemistry,"Hey everybody,

I am a junior at UMass Amherst majoring in biology and minoring in chemistry. I was wondering if anyone would have insight on what ‚Äúlevel‚Äù or ‚Äútier‚Äù of biological sciences Ph.D. programs I should apply to. Would I be a competitive applicant at a top school like MIT or Harvard, or should I set my sights a little lower? 

I am in the Commonwealth Honors College, have a 3.944 GPA, 4.0 major GPA, and a publication in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS). I have been working in a research lab on-campus since my freshman year and have worked full-time both summers. I will hopefully work this summer as well, CoV allowing. I think I can get another publication or two in if I return to the lab and work full-time. My PI is well-known in his field (H-index 112) and I think I‚Äôll have a strong letter of rec from him and my previous PI.

Is thinking MIT pretentious of me? Are there anyways I could improve my chances?

Biochemistry,"I am running through some videos to review for USMLE. There is a question where it does not make sense that one of the final two choices was eliminated. Thanks in advanced!

Vignette: 55 y.o. alcoholic brought to ER after passing out from night of drinking. He was given thiamine injection and overnight parenteral glucose. Next morning patient is alert and serum thiamine was normal. Blood glucose is 73 mg/dl (4mM). 

Question: at the time of discharge, which of the following proteins would have no significant physiological activity in the patient?

1) malate dehydrogenase

2) Glucokinase

3) alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase

4) GLUT 1 transporter

5) PFK-1

&amp;#x200B;

I narrowed it down to 2 and 5. My reasoning is that both are regulated by insulin, however due to the slightly low lvl of blood glc, insulin should not be particularly active. Therefore glucokinase shouldn't be active. PFK-2 should also not be active in liver and therefore PFK-1 would not be turned on either. So both these enzymes would be showing low levels of physiological activity.

The answer, however, is 2. The reason given for not selecting PFK-1 is that it is only affected by insulin in the liver, therefore in other tissues (i.e. muscle) PFK-1 would be active and participating in glycolysis. 

I am confused: the reasoning does not make sense to me. If there is little insulin activity (due to the lvl of blood glc) wouldn't that mean that PFK-1 is also not activated even in the liver? If elsewhere in the body, then wouldn't it also be inactive since glucokinase (and therefore no F6P) is not active either?

The only explanation I could think is that Hexokinase is still working and therefore there will still be F6P substrate for PFK-1 to convert into F1,6P, and thereby continuing glycolysis.

However, under the conditions of no exercise, wouldn't ATP and Citrate from KREB inhibit PFK-1 anyways and stop it from working?",Need help with a question - not homework

I know everything will probably be fine but I can't rationalize that it will be, so I'm hoping someone on here can bring me some comfort.

I'm set to graduate in a month, and I've work so hard over the past two years to bring up my GPA after a rough sophomore year, so I can have a better shot at getting into a good grad program. I had decided to wait to apply to any programs so I could continue to bring up my GPA during my senior spring semester, and honestly so I could have a year of my youth to not have to stress over school. 

Here is where my panic is kicking in, this pandemic is really killing my academic performance. I have some pretty horrible anxiety, and the combination of world events, existing mental health issues, and school, have left me in a ball of constant anxiety and depressive episodes. I'm not exaggerating when I say I've been crying for two hours over one comp chem assignment I just can't figure out, and the feeling of inadequacy that followed. I'm struggling to keep up with assignments and material, which is something I've never had an issue with before.

I'm worried my grades are not going to be where I had originally planned... I know I would be in a much better spot gradewise if life were normal, I had nearly a 4.0 last semester (I earned a B in a 1 credit course üò§) and was planning on reaching my 4.0 goal this semester. The way things are looking right now I doubt I'll be getting that 4.0.

It's too late to take my classes pass/fail, and I should have taken that option but at the time I felt as though I would be able to handle the work independently with out a problem. Clearly I overestimated how well I was going to handle life during this pandemic, and I'm freaking out about the prospects of grad school. I know for a fact there are going to be so many students out there that will have grades for this semester that show they can work well under pressure, and since I opted out of pass/fail, if my grades tank I fear it'll be like a flare that I am unable to handle the pressure of a graduate program. 

On top of all this I was planning on taking the GRE this summer and it was cancelled, so I don't even have that under my belt yet üòû Uhg, I regret not applying last fall, but hindsight is 20:20.

I guess I'm hoping someone out there might have an idea as to how grad programs might be addressing this spring semester for their applicants. Or suggestions on how I could address my grades for this semester if they do drop. I know most universities automatically switched to a pass/fail grading scale, so there must be some sort of adjustment that will be implemented for future applicants.

I have firmly established in my mind to pursue this area of study.

Biochemistry,"Hello ! First Reddit post here - please go easy on me :)

5 months ago I've decided to change careers, and get a degree in Biochemistry, Biotech &amp; molecular biology. I had no formal education but through an access to higher education course, I'm glad to say I've been made an offer to study the course above.

I want to learn as much as possible (before and after the course actually starts), so I've been studying from 3 different books:

1- David Klein's Organic Chemistry (224 pages in).

2- Chemistry for the Bio-sciences (120 pages in) (I was studying Stryer, but found overlapping areas (thermodynamics as an example, with David's book + it took me about a day to go through a page).

3 - Molecular biology of the cell (20 pages in).

My main goal is to eventually get into synthetic biology and bioinformatics - would you say my current plan is ideal? Any suggestions as per what to add/focus on?

Thanks in advance!",Learning path

Biochemistry,"After topical antibiotics and/or retinoid and/or benzoyl peroxide, dermatologists commonly prescribe oral antibiotics before isotretinoin. But why? Here are my premises for why oral antibiotics can't permanently cure acne.  

1. Presume that the patient dutifully consumes the [full prescribed course of antibiotics](https://biology.stackexchange.com/q/48724/4466).

1. Antibiotics may reduce the number of, but can't kill to the last drop, bacterium, like *Cutibacterium acnes*.

2. Acne sufferers don't usually live in a sterile environment, and *C. acnes* may be floating in the air or lying on surfaces. Even if antibiotics kill every single bacterium of *C. acnes* this time, it'll probably colonize you again. Unlike most pathogens targeted by antibiotics, *C. acnes* is

 &gt; largely [commensal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commensalism ""Commensalism"") and part of the [skin flora](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin_flora ""Skin flora"") present on most healthy adult humans' skin.[\[8\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutibacterium_acnes#cite_note-8) It is usually just barely detectable on the skin of healthy preadolescents. It lives, among other things, primarily on [fatty acids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatty_acid ""Fatty acid"") in [sebum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sebum ""Sebum"") secreted by sebaceous glands in the [follicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hair_follicle ""Hair follicle""). It may also be found throughout the [gastrointestinal tract](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal_tract ""Gastrointestinal tract"").[\[9\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutibacterium_acnes#cite_note-expert-reviews2003-9)

3. Oral antibiotics mustn't be consumed forever.

3. After antibiotics kill most of the *C. acnes* and the patient stops taking the antibiotic, the remaining *C. acnes* (perhaps now resistant to that antibiotic) will proliferate to its formerly high concentration, and cause acne again. 

My argument befits  the comments beneath.

phi and psi angles are just torsion angles for allowed conformations for the amino acids but nothing to do with alpha carbon-carbon so A is wrong?

I think 100% of phi and psi needs to be known not 10% so B is wrong?

Also torsion angles are just the allowed conformations for aminos and they don't expand downstream angles so that's wrong too.

Biochemistry,"**So I am being asked to draw the dipeptide between Asp-His at 7.0 pH**

**Here is the answer: https://imgur.com/7uQ0dMS**

As I learned from my class, if pH &lt; pKa = protante and if pH &gt; pkA = deprotante 

Since pH 7 is less than pKa of NH3 which is 9 then we protante NH3+ into NH3 2+?

Since pH 7 is bigger than pKa of COOH which is 2 then we deprotnate COO- into COO 2-?

Now that we covered the terminal ends, we can move to R groups of each 

Since both Asp and His have a 3rd titratble protein in their side chain we have to cover the charge of the R group of each amino.

For Aspartic acid pKa of side chain is 3.90 so its less than 7 pH so we deprotante the side chain of Asp and since the side chain is already - it becomes -2?

For Histidine the side chain is 6.04 so its also less than 7 so we deprotante here as well but since the side chain of His is + charge then actually it becomes neutral.

The answer I linked above doesn't show the +2 or -2 charges on the terminal NH3+, COO-, or the R group of Asp but only as + or - for the terminals and R group and the only change it shows is His group instead of being + its neutral as I solved it.

Basically it looks like the charges are never written as 2+ or 2- but only as +,-, or neutral is this correct?",Dipeptide between Asp-His question

Biochemistry,"Writing this at my gas station job bored as all hell.

There‚Äôs a lot of history to go on, but I‚Äôll do my best to TLDR at the end.

As a Freshman Biochemistry Major, I passed the first two Biology classes with relative ease (idk the specific names of the curriculum sorry), including passing College Algebra and College Geometry. I skipped Intro Chemistry due to a complicated extracurricular schedule my first semester, and barely passed Intro Chem my second semester with a C.

Come Summer 2019 I wanted to catch up by taking Gen Chem 1 at my local community college. I passed, though I can‚Äôt really say I learned anything from the old-as-balls professor. By accident, I totally forgot to send the transfer equivalency forms, and missed my window of opportunity to take Gen Chem 2 at my main college for Sophomore Fall 2019. I took Algebra-Based Physics, Calculus and Sophomore Biology. No chemistry. I dropped from Calculus, and barely passed Physics and Biology.

Now comes the big fuckup: Sophomore Spring  Semester 2020. I have only passed two semesters of Chemistry, but I am taking Junior-Level Biology, Gen Chem 2, Creative Writing (Hobby) and retaking Calculus.

My advisor admitted to me that she made a mistake in approving my admittance to the Junior Biology class, as I hadn‚Äôt had any experience with Organic Chemistry. I dropped out of that class before the first exam.

Then came Gen Chem 2. I really have no excuse for why I dropped it. I bombed the first exam, and then that was it. I‚Äôm now riding on 6 credits this semester, with Calculus and Creative Writing, and being bored out of my mind, I started using lots of drugs. 

Now, with the big pandemic, I‚Äôm just sitting here at my home state, working at a gas station to pass the time before online classes start, feeling like a failure.

The problem here is that I used to be such a good student. It really hurt me when I dropped Biology, and I‚Äôm going to need three more semesters of Chemistry classes (assuming I can pass them) before I can retake the Biology. 

I feel so confused and everyone I know is telling me to switch my major to English or some other bullshit, when I know in my heart that I want this major even if it‚Äôs super fucking hard. I don‚Äôt really know what to do to maintain the work-life balance necessary to keep going. Please help me on this.

Thanks everyone.

TL:DR My undergrad timeline is totally fucked up, and I‚Äôm resigned to become a six year student with where I‚Äôm going. I feel like a failure and none of my peers are supporting me. I don‚Äôt want to give up. What can I do?",Very Confused Junior: Continuing in Biochemistry
Biochemistry,"I‚Äôm doing a science course at the moment in uni that allows me to experience different science subjects for two years before choosing my major. I‚Äôm still in first year, but I already know that I‚Äôm going to choose a biology subject. I‚Äôm looking at genetics, microbiology and pharmacology as subjects I will try during my second year, and on top of that, I‚Äôm considering biochemistry. 

 I‚Äôm doing organic chemistry right now, and while I‚Äôm fine with the theory behind organic chemistry, I absolutely HATE the labs (which mainly involve chemical synthesis). This is kind of putting me off doing biochemistry, as I‚Äôm not sure if I would like the labs (and this is coming from someone who usually loves labs, at least when it‚Äôs based in biology). 

 The biochemistry course is a lot more biology focused, you aren‚Äôt expected to take more chemistry modules than other biology majors (there‚Äôs a lot of overlap for core), and the degree title is ‚ÄúBiochemistry with Molecular Biology‚Äù, which probably says a lot. 

 I will still have to do biochemistry modules next year no matter what I do (Biomolecular sciences, Biomolecular lab skills one and two). Being eligible for biochemistry as a major is just an extra module that doesn‚Äôt involve any lab work on top of my others. 

 Should I cut my losses and avoid biochemistry (and try out neuroscience or physiology instead (which would be useful if I wanted to do pharma, but probably not as much as biochemistry)? I HATE physics though, and I dropped intro physics last year, but I would have to do it again), or should I do biochemistry and see what it is like?",I don‚Äôt know if I should do biochemistry next year

Anyone can help, but please don't confuse the issue by guessing.  Reference numbers on specific points to help. 

&amp;#x200B;

1. Viruses and bacteria are made of proteins (like fat or oil)
2. They stick to your skin (don't need the mechanism, just that they do). 
3. Water alone won't wash them off because water and oil don't mix.
4. I'm going to use a small pom-pom as a virus or bacteria, saying it looks the same (a sphere with little spiky ends?)  
5. Soap has a molecule where one end attaches to water and the other to the proteins in viruses or bacteria.  
6. The soap attaches the water and virus together, pulling it off your hand. 
7. Bonus, the soap molecules also pull the virus apart, killing it. 
8. But it needs at least 20 seconds to... 
   1. attach to every molecule of virus, so it can be rinsed off?  OR
   2. Pull the virus apart and kill it? 
9. Extra bonus.  It doesn't matter if you use antibacterial soap or not.   Because...
   1. Covid-19 is a virus, not bacteria so it doesn't work as well? Because?   OR
   2. Soap does the same job as the alcohol in antibacterial soap?  


Now to Sanitizer.

1. Alcohol has a molecule that does the same thing.  (use just velcro strips with no marbles for 'water).  But when you use hand sanitizer, the alcohol pulls the viruses apart then evaporates.  So your skin is still covered in dead bacteria and viruses.  And if there's also dirt on your skin you might not get all of them.  So wash your hands as soon as you can. 
2. 60% alcohol is the best.

I take it because I found out that resveratrol could mimic fasting and exercise and possibly slow ageing. Pterostilbene is supposedly a more bio-available (4 times as) and longer-lasting molecule (9 times longer) with from what I understand many of the same properties.

I am probably taking twice the recommended dose. mainly because the 200mg capsules were cheap and when I take them I feel I can focus really well at work and also I just feel rather good.

I saw in some study that they had given 3000mg/kg pterostilbene and quercetin to some mice and for at least a month. So that is a positive. Still, the old saying is that we are not mice.

I believe I have read that pterostilbene is cytotoxic and can kill cancer cells. But I am thinking that then it is probably also killing healthy cells...

Biochemistry,"So basically, I read somewhere that if we give a serum with the corresponding antibodies to a sick person, he will heal, but won't be immunized. So I thought about something else. I only have a basic understanding of the immune system, but I've read somewhere that to get immunity, a random B cell has to produce the right antibody, and if it does, it will multiply and create memory cells, that will make sure the body ""remembers"" the immunity. But what if we could engineer those cells to create an antibody? Like I take a B cell from person A, who's sick from a strain of the flu, and modify the part that codes for the antibody it'll produce for the antibody he needs. There won't be any adverse reaction, since the lymphocyte has the genome of person A. We could then just find an/a few antibodies that work against this particular strain of the flu, and just engineer the B cell(s) to produce it/them.",Is there another way to immunize people?

Biochemistry,"I was going through my old biochemistry notes and I noticed we had calculated in class how efficiently our body uses glucose. I noticed that our calculation didn't match the calories per gram equivalencies that are used for macronutrients; 4 calories per gram carbohydrate, 4 calories per gram protein, 9 calories per gram fat.

&amp;#x200B;

So we get about 32 mol ATP/mol glucose and -30.5 kJ/mol ATP, which equals -976 kJ/mol glucose.

1/180 mol glucose/gram glucose times -976 kJ/mol glucose equals 5.42 kJ/gram glucose or 1.30 kcal/gram glucose. Which does not match what is said about one gram of carbohydrate being 4 calories.

&amp;#x200B;

I also had in my notes that Œî*G'¬∞* of glucose is -2870 kJ/mol and that the body operates at around 34% efficiency (-976kJ/-2870kJ). If we plug in -2870 kJ/mol instead of -976kJ/mol, we get \~4 kcal/gram glucose, so I'm assuming this is where the caloric equivalencies for macronutrients come from. Is this correct?

&amp;#x200B;

Another question is does the \~66% of energy that is not used to create ATP essentially become body heat? As in, is that excess energy during the catabolic reactions is transferred to enzymes and surrounding molecules such as water, etc. which basically becomes body heat? Which also would imply that the if one consumes 2000 calories, only about 680 of that turns ADP + Pi into ATP. Or am I just missing something here?",Calculating calories per gram macronutrients

Biochemistry,"I'm having maddening difficulty placing ligands in wincoot. Here's my problem. I have densities that I know are sulfates and acetates. I tried using Phenix's ligandfit but it wasn't able to place SO4 or ACT in any relevant position. No problem, I think, just add them manually in wincoot. I'll add SO4 using the ""place atom at pointer"" tool, real space refine, merge molecule to my model, real space refine again. For ACT I'll get the monomer from the main menu, add it to the pointer, real space refine, merge molecule to my model, real space refine again. 

I am absolutely doing something wrong but I cannot figure out what. For starters, wincoot will frequently crash when merging molecules. Secondly, if I make a change to any unusual rotamers (using the Unusual Rotamer Graphs tool in wincoot) I'll see a bunch of blue bars for placed ACT and SO4s with titles like ""ACT Missing Atoms"" suddenly appear all over the place. Finally, if I take my final model from coot, refine it in Phenix, I'll get an error of something like ""Number of nonbonded interaction distances &lt; 0.001: integer"" with integer being between 5 and 20.

It also seems really improbable to me because: 1) the transmembrane region is never exposed to the ER lumen where all those glycosylation enzymes are; 2) sugars are polar so I guess that they would decrease the ability of a protein domain to stay in hydrophobic membrane.

So once the viral rna is inside of the the cytoplasm, ribosomes read it and create a protein known as RDRP or rna dependent RNA polymerase.

1. Describe antibiotics, explain how it works and discuss what problems there are regarding the use of this drug. Remember to raise the issue from several different perspectives.

**Here's my answer:**

Antibiotics are a type of medicine used to treat bacterial infections. To stay healthy, we must maintain a healthy ecosystem of bacteria, which we usually call normal flora, those are microbes and can be found in the gut, and then we call it gut flora. These microbes have a flora characteristic of their type, and by many, we mean a part of the body where microorganisms live. These bacteria have the function of inhibiting the reproduction of other pathogenic bacteria by activating the hemoglobin of the immune system (protein found in human red blood cells and many animals, are responsible for oxygen transport in the blood), metabolic functions such as degradation (break up into smaller components) of fiber, production of fatty acids, and production of vitamin.

Pathogenic bacteria will have difficulty competing for receptors - found on the cell membrane - and nutrients due to these benign bacteria, usually the normal flora is damaged by the use of antibiotics to disrupt the number of normal flora relative to the increase in antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This can cause diarrhea and other harmful symptoms of the mucous membranes. If we take an example of a common type of benign gut in the gut, it is E. Coli, and they help in the digestive process and help prevent dangerous bacteria from getting attached to the gut. But they can also cause infections in humans if they end up in a place outside their normal flora, namely the urinary tract, and thus this leads to urinary tract infection. This can be a laborious process for humans and lead to painful mimicry, but this can be handled through so-called narrow-spectrum antibiotics. As it sounds, it is useful for only a certain type of bacteria. If the bacteria are susceptible to antibiotics, they will stop growing or die, which may be because bacteria have DNA, protein, and sugar in the cell wall, enzymes to form new bacterial DNA or protein. For example, by deactivating the enzyme that builds up and repairs the cell wall of a bacterium, we can kill the bacterium by diffusing water into the bacterium, and it swells and explodes. Some antibiotics get their effect by blocking the cell's ability to create proteins by binding to the ribosomes in the cell. This prevents the bacterium from completing protein synthesis, and this protein is essential for cell structure, for enzymes, and for transport. We can call this the protein synthesis inhibition.

However, there are a few differences between harmful and good bacteria. Antibiotics kill not only the bad bacteria that make the person sick, but also the bacteria found in the flora. In addition, loss of benign bacteria can give other types of bacteria room to multiply, which can lead to a possibility of infection. Sometimes these infections occur when bacteria from the environment that we come into contact with entering the body, and the benign bacteria are damaged by an antibiotic that we ingest. If we take in an antibiotic that kills too many friendly bacteria in the gut, harmful bacteria are reproduced that can form toxins that make the person in question sick with symptoms such as fever, nausea, diarrhea, and inflammation. It is precisely because of these factors that the doctor sometimes does not recommend the use of antibiotics for an extended period of time; otherwise, it leads to antibiotic resistance and other diseases through natural selection. Antibiotic resistance occurs due to changes or mutations in the DNA of the bacteria, and these changes allow the bacteria to survive the effects of antibiotics designed to kill them. This means that when an antibiotic is used, all bacteria that have not undergone a mutation are killed, while the antibiotic-resistant bacteria remain unaffected. The presence of resistant bacterial strains means that antibiotics or drugs designed to kill them no longer work, allowing them to spread quickly, which poses a risk to public health on the macro scale. When this happens, it is necessary for scientists to develop new antibiotics that the bacteria do not have resistance to. If we look at this from different levels, it is from an economic point of view an important issue in society that one should be careful about hygiene so that one does not fall for the various problems that we face with these bacteria and have to take antibiotics precisely on because of the problems it can cause in the body of a human. Furthermore, antibiotics can be used on animals before they are slaughtered for their meat to be sold to stores, but if the animal's bacterial resistance spreads with the food and otherwise it becomes harmful to humans. Antibiotic resistance is, therefore, a major problem because of this, when antibiotics cease to have a good effect, more expensive medicines will be introduced in the market as drug development will not take place so quickly, and selection and selection will not be so wide for the public. If we look at this problem from a social plan, it can be found that antibiotic-resistant bacteria are hazardous for those who have intercourse with many different partners, and therefore these dangerous bacteria spread to others, which in turn become infected and have intercourse with another person and so on. This is a destructive cycle for humanity if one does not contribute an effective drug for this kind of disease. What happens when antibiotic resistance leads to stomach upset, and you have to sit in a hospital for long periods, and there are few places for people to use their place in the hospital. In some parts of the world, all these costs and you have to pay to be treated by doctors, in fairly high sums too. The only positive effect of antibiotic resistance that I can think of is that it can eventually be killed by research and find new antibiotics for this specific bacterium. When developing new drugs, you usually use lab rubs as it is commonly called, and these are used on antibiotics to investigate if the bacteria die within the rat. This is also a question of ethics in research, but this is when you ask yourself whether it is right to laboratory animals, which can make people think differently about this particular question, depending on who you ask. Scientists and the elite may think this is fair, while animal lovers and environmental activists are against this treatment of animals.

Did I answer the question in-depth with regards to the details, and did I use correct and relevant terminology throughout? Did I analyze and search for answers to complex questions about microorganisms and their importance for health and disease? Did I discuss in depth and nuanced complex issues that affect this? In the discussion, did I present well-founded and nuanced arguments and give a detailed and nuanced account of the consequences of several positions? Did I highlight relevant new issues that will guide the discussion forward?

I am asking this list of questions because these are the criterias that I have to fulfill for the answer to be approved by my peers. Thanks.",How does antibiotics work? What problems are there regarding the use of this drug?
Biochemistry,"Blood clots in arteries, for example in the coronary vessels, can be dissolved by injecting streptokinase into the blood. Streptokinase is formed by bacteria and rapidly breaks down the blood clot. The first treatment with streptokinase is much more effective than the second treatment. The diagram below shows the concentration of anti-streptokinase antibodies in the blood after the first and second injection of streptokinase, respectively. The second injection occurred 10 weeks after the first.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/pmsq2q18kik41.png?width=284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=361f39adeb4faa4b0d7528ea12d7e71d42d7e9b1

The picture shows the amount of anti-streptokinase antibodies in the blood depending on the time after injection for the number of weeks.

* Solid line = first injection
* Dashed line = second injection

a) Compare the effect of first and second injection streptokinase during the first 4 weeks. How can the difference in immunological response be explained?

b) What is the reason why the manufacturer does not recommend the use of streptokinase in the event of a second clot shortly after the first?

**My answer:** I read that immunological memory reacts faster and with higher intensity on repeated exposure. I also think that the second injection cannot be administered shortly after the first to mitigate the thrombolytic effect of the streptokinase (a little will save a life; too much is bad). I think the reason the antibody level goes up after the second injection is that the body has had time to undergo antibody class switching and is then able to mount a rapid immune response against streptokinase, as it is a non-self protein. I also know that streptokinase comes from bacteria so it can easily illicit an immune response compared to other proteins. As for the difference in immune responses, the first time the body is exposed to a brand new foreign material, it won‚Äôt have any memory cells that respond to the antigen. If it activates the humoral immune response and produces memory cells, then subsequent exposures will elicit a huge production of the antibodies to neutralize the antigen.

Can I add more depth to this? And is the main reason you only use it on the first heart attack is that it‚Äôs a bacterially derived protein and allergic reactions are common, and it may lose its effectiveness quickly?

I know that the increased amount of antibodies against streptokinase may explain why streptokinase was not effective the second time, and we can see it on the dotted line. These antibodies prevent streptokinase from acting on the blood clot, and are subsequently formed when the streptokinase is injected. The process itself is that the antibodies bind to streptokinase, which causes them to bind up in large clumps and cannot function properly, the immune cells break down the streptokinase because the immune system sees it as a foreign substance. Is there anything else I should add? I think I am missing some explanations.",Immunological response to antibodies?

If you guys are not familiar with this, basically when I read a chapter and review the lecture for the chapter, I get the main ideas but sometimes I have little questions about some parts.

Please you do not have to answer everything below, I know it can be long but most of that stuff is just me rambling. Anyways here it goes

Q1) About protein structure in general: https://imgur.com/UQydEeH

It says secondary structure results from H bonding, my question is, is the primary structure just 1 amino acid sequence or it can be multiple amino acids? For secondary structure the H bonding its not talking about how amino acids are connected via peptide bond or is it? I ask cos I thought H bonding is involved in the backbone of the protein just to keep alpha helix structure.

Q2) https://imgur.com/Vxagrh7

Question about mechanism here for polypeptide bond formation, let me know if I misunderstood this part, basically amine group of one amino acid attacks carbonyl of another and kicks off 1 bond for the electrons to go on oxygen &gt; the oxygen electrons move back to form the double bond again and kick off the OH &gt; OH attacks H of nitrogen and we lose water and form peptide bond.

But in the picture it doesn't show when nitrogen attacks carbonyl, doesn't show what happens after.

Q3) About peptide group bond angle:

https://imgur.com/OeVZkhK and https://imgur.com/fKr3XAp

I understood peptide bonds limit conformation cos of their bond angle and so the R groups are alternating because of this. But I didn't understand how they limit conformation? Or I just need to know they limit conformation cos of their bond angle

Do I need to worry about the phi and psi here? Not sure what I want to learn here other than if they are specified then we get backbone path that is known.

Q4) psi and phi is used here: https://imgur.com/E29iYrO

Also not sure whats going on here, I know this is about bond angle How can they tell from the diagram that proline is most restricticed and glycine is least restricted? I understand proline strcuture is cyclic so its very steric hindered and glycine is only H r group so that's less hindered, but should I worry about this?

Not sure what the blue/green and the C,alpha,alphaL, arrows means...

Q5) beta sheet and alpha helix: https://imgur.com/CSjEGFv and https://imgur.com/W0Xzo9Y

So looking at pictures I can't tell too much difference between alpha helix and beta sheet. I know they both have H bonding but I'm not sure whats the key difference between them? The only thing I can spot is that the alpha helix is kinda like DNA while the beta sheet is parallel or anti to each other but thas it

I started taking Vyvanse last week to treat ADHD and for the most part I've felt good. Vyvanse is a longer lasting form of adderall.

I asked my professor who helped a bit (showed me TLC with Ninhydrin reagent but that is just to tell which amino acids are present I believe, not how much), but I am otherwise lost.

Biochemistry,"Just went over a lecture in my biochem class that went over recombinant DNA technology and I had some questions I wanted someone to clear up

**1) https://imgur.com/XfJZ7cf about restriction endonucleases**

I get the restriction endonuclease and its function here but I don't get what they say about bacteria and methyl groups... I am guessing the restriction endonuclease (RE) is taken from bacteria because bacteria have this RE enzyme which recognizes foreign DNA due to foreign DNA not having a methyl group? If that's correct then why does RE in bacteria being able to recognize foreign DNA that doesn't have a methyl group makes the REs significant in recombination? 

**2) https://imgur.com/TaJxBi3 about gel electrophoresis**

Does ethidium bromide get mixed with DNA before DNA is added to the gel or is ethidium bromide already is on the gel and DNA comes after? I get ethidium bromide has the fluorecent dye

**3) https://imgur.com/NT5m7UO about cDNA**

I get that recombination requires cDNA because we don't need introns, just the exons part, my question is, when RE is going to cleave DNA, it needs to be in the cDNA ""format"" with exons only correctly? Also why we don't need introns? I know that exons are proteins but would introns mess up recombination or smth?

**4) https://imgur.com/nII7Kw3 about expression vector**

Can someone explain to me the ""bacteriophage T7""? The slide is kinda confusing. It kinda sounds that we are inserting T7 RNA polymerase along with our gene of interest, where the RNA polymerase will guide our DNA? Or I'm wrong here? My professor said that we can add antibiotic resistance gene along with our gene of interest into the vector and that we gona get bacteria that lives in ampicillin and others that die, and the ones that live mean they have our gene of interest. So can I think of this ""bacteriophage T7"" as a resistance gene?

Second question about expression vector, does the host vector already have a ""promoter"" or does the promoter come from the gene and RNA polymerase that we put into the vector? I'm just kinda confused on whats going on in the figure

**5) https://imgur.com/0A9EtNx multiple choice question**

I understand ""sticky end"" is a single strand of repeating palindromes at end of a double stranded DNA right? I know the answer here is C but can't it also be D? What would make D not be the answer here?

**6) https://imgur.com/pW8ORVg another multiple choice question**

I know 2. Is wrong cos cDNA only has exons so only choices C and D are correct, I know the answer is D but can't C also be correct? 

Is 3. Correct? Does cDNA have a promoter? If so then I answered my previous question that a promoter is not found in host vector on its own, but it is introduced when we add foreign DNA to vector.

For option 4, does the gene of interest not have to be from the same organism? It could be from any other organism correct?

**7) This one is just a question I had but whats difference between CRISPR-Cas9 and restirction endonucleases,vectors and just cloning of DNA in general also whats difference between recombination vs PCR?**

From what I understand is that CRISPR-Cas9 allows you to modify and delete/insert DNA while recombination allows you to insert a gene of a interest and have to clone over billions of copies right?

If so then whats difference between recombinant DNA technology and PCR? Since PCR also makes billions of clones",Can someone clear some confusion on recombination DNA?

Biochemistry,"&gt;Mast cell researcher Lawrence Afrin, M.D., posits that a rare condition called mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) may be the cause of the phenomenon. In MCAS, mast cells spontaneously release over 200 inflammatory molecules known as mediators, including the substance noradrenaline (norepinephrine). Afrin describes a case report of a man with MCAS who grew ill and appeared to ""smoke"" in the presence of several witnesses. Afrin writes that the release of large amounts of norepinephrine, or perhaps another mast cell-derived substance, could turn on a regulatory protein called UCP-1 in greater-than-normal amounts. UCP-1 causes adipose oxidization to be released as heat. Adipose tissue is a known repository of mast cells. Under the right circumstances, a sudden flood of norepinephrine released from adipose mast cells could activate the UCP-1 ""switch"" and cause heat generation in excess of 90 degrees Celsius. Once the adipose tissue were ignited, it would in theory burn itself out, inclusive of bone marrow.

Biochemistry,"Hi guys,

so I'll try to make this post as detailed and clear as possible, and not too long as well.

What happened to me is a miracle. Raw garlic simply changed my life inside-out, after YEARS of searching for a cure for my bloating, IBS, brain fog, insomnia and other general health problems.

&amp;#x200B;

**MY STORY:**

I am underweight and generally a very healthy young 27yo man.

However since I was 18, I started losing my hair and had a bad tooth decay, I began to be skinny, lost all my weight and could never gain it back. I had depression and digestive issues which continued for years. Part of that meant that I had something called ''Intestinal Paralysis'', which is much more painful than it sounds - I was hospitalized because I was about to die from that, however, according to the doctors they found nothing - therefore it was emotional. I believed it WAS. But... Perhaps not?

&amp;#x200B;

**Symptoms lately**:

\-9 years ago I started losing weight/hair/teeth that I could never gain back. Im underweight, 68KG.

\-Bloating every single day, no MATTER what diet I am on (including carnivore or \[healthy\] KETO). That means a VERY DECREASED APETITE for no reason.

\-Skin issues (dermatitis).

\-Depression and anxiety.

\-Terrible brain fog.

&amp;#x200B;

**Attempts to solve it:**

\-Stopping caffeine which helped a lot with anxiety and insomnia.

\-Apple cider vinegar which helps with bloating (sometimes!)

\-Breathing to the upper chest instead of the diaphragm (yes, for me it's actually much better to do that for some reason. I've read that SIBO has something to do with that).

\-General exercise, cold showers, following my passions in life, spirituality etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**Conclusion:**

**NOTHING** helped me as much as RAW GARLIC did to my system. 

I did a healthy KETO and Carnivore diet. I tried veganism and raw veganism.

I always remain bloated at the end of the day no matter what I do. And yes I'm not stupid - I treated my body and mind with full attention; balancing electrolytes, getting enough sleep, hydration, supplementation, variety of foods, not eating at night, etc.

**So my question is...**

What is it in garlic (alliin) that completely RESETS me and makes me feel like a teenager again?

I have NOT found anything online about this. I suspect it's related to some SIBO, microbacteria, fungi or some other stuff that is ruining my digestive system and eats away the nutrients from the food that I eat. 

**And I don't want to rely on garlic because**:

\-Poor people having to speak with me.

\-It's just putting a bandage on a wound instead of treating the root cause.

Biochemistry,"Hello all, 

I am an author working on a new book. The basic premise is a post-apocalyptic world where a group of people attempt to survive in the United States as the infrastructure continues to crumble, \~30 years after the collapse. Why am I in this sub, though?

Well, first off, I write hard science fiction and fantasy, so accuracy is high on my priorities. As for why I came to this sub specifically, however, well *(spoiler warning for people seeing this post years from now when the book is out)*:

This specific flavor of post-apocalypse is societal collapse due to a contagion (in the most generic, layman sense of the word) and I am working on the details of this contagion. The idea is that this contagion basically facilitates hormone hyperactivity. Once a person hits puberty, they gradually produce hormones at a greater and greater rate. 

This means the teenage angst years are only the beginning and it also means most of the survivors are kids and teens. Literally, it is terrifying, as every kid knows they will eventually grow into a monster, but metaphorically, it is the fear of every young teen as they hit the wild unknown of the body that is puberty. Part of this is ‚Äúzombies,‚Äù but that really just means people so zonked out on emotional overdose that they act without thinking things through. Anger, lust, suicidal tendencies? They are a lot harder to resist or self-diffuse.  For example, unchecked testosterone means fury, fighting, and a lot of muscle growth. Ultimately, it means the people with less pronounced puberty effects end up living longer.  

Before anything else, I would like to know if an illness like this is objectively impossible. I would have to imagine it isn‚Äôt, but writing a whole book on a completely bad premise would be the worst. 

Assuming it is possible, I wanted to know *how* it might theoretically occur. I don‚Äôt mean some archaeologist uncovers a civilization and an ancient disease returns, but rather physiologically. That question led me here, as I assumed biochemists might be able to lend me some wisdom.

[Elevators \(level of elevator\) represents potential energy level of heavy atom chain in reactant and product. The H indicates the position of the reactive hydrogen on the chain. Black wall between elevators represents the potential energy barrier. Figure1: Reactant and Product are in minimum of potential energy well.

Less activation energy needed for reaction, because enzyme makes Transistion State energetically more favourable. Figure4:  Hydrogen Tunneling model in enzymatic reactions, Hydrogens are seen as Quatum particles with a probability wavefunction\(red and blue\).  Enzyme brings reactant and product on degenerate energy level, with small Donor-Acceptor Distance the wavefunctions overlap and Hydrogen tunneling can occur instantaniously.

3. Tertiary structure - The overall 3-D configuration of the molecule such as the double helix (which i believe is just the overall structure due to the A/B/Z - DNA secondary structural motifs?)
4. Quaternary Structure - DNA complexes with histones to form nucleosomes and become compact and form other structures like chromosomes

Biochemistry,"Hello everyone, I'm a grad student studying protein-protein interactions, and I do a lot of SPR experiments and MD simulations. Is it possible for several different pairs of protein-protein interactions (say different isoforms of the same proteins, or the same proteins from different species-it doesn't really matter) to have the same or very similar Kd values (dissociation constant) in equilibrium, but require differing forces to unbind the complexes? I guess what I'm asking is, is anyone aware of some sort of thermodynamic equation showing how force can modify the equilibrium binding affinity?
 I found this paper (https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acs.biochem.9b00453) that gives this relation: Kd(F) = Kd*e‚àíŒ≤Œîœï(F), and that the Œîœï(F) term depends on a Œîx term, but I'm not exactly clear on what that Œîx is referring to.

Biochemistry,"I know it probably sounds daft but the documentary had some terrifying cases of this, including a woman who survived it, it was a woman in her 30's and she said she suddenly felt hot in her throat, and then flames started spewing from her mouth. She drank water and the fire was put out, but she sustained 3rd degree burns to her stomach and intestines and had a scar on her abdomen because of the heat of the fire coming from her gut.

The others weren't so lucky and were found reduced to a pile of ashes. For example there was one where a son was talking to his mother upstairs, then he went downstairs for 15 minutes. He then came back up to find his mother was burned to death in her chair, with her legs and arms and head intact but the stomach area was completely burned out and reduced to ashes.

Ever since that I can't stop thinking my gut will suddenly catch fire. The documentary had a British chemist named John Emsley mention that our guts produce a self-combusting liquid called diphosphane but in tiny amounts, too small to cause self-combustion, but in some cases it can produce too much and this ignites all the other flammable stuff in the gut and can blow a hole through the abdomen in some cases as it's more like a fiery explosion.

Another terrifying fatal case was witnessed by relatives and the woman was just reading a newspaper when suddenly blue flames burst from her mouth and gut area before she died. The documentary had a terrifying reconstruction of this, specifically when her relative looked away for a second and suddenly saw flames in the corner of his eye, only to see her spewing flames out of her mouth and abdomen like a dragon, while she was completely motionless/in shock.

Ever since I can't stop thinking about my gut just bursting into flames and burning to death from it. I always have a glass of water next to me in case it happens, and when I go to sleep I have a 2 L bottle of water next to me. I hate being human sometimes our bodies are so badly designed, I've never heard of birds exploding into flames and there's like a hundred times more birds than people.

Whenever I'm talking with friends I get anxious, thinking they might suddenly start having fire bursting out their mouth and gut, then keel over and burn to death from the inside out, and imagining how traumatised I'd be if that happens. This case is one of the most haunting ones for me - https://enacademic.com/dic.nsf/enwiki/1034226

I'm an undergrad majoring biochem at university in Australia about to enter my third and final year of study. I'm quite confident that I want to take either an academic or industry career path, I'm just not sure whether its best to complete an honours degree after my undergrad or try complete a masters of research, to then progress into a PhD program (or maybe try work in industry if I can idk).

The reason I'm unsure is because unlike other countries, most Australian universities only require me to complete an honours before progressing into a PhD program, which doesn't follow the typical bolonga model. I did some work in a research lab last year and one of the post-docs (french) told me I would come out more qualified with a masters of research, and would be better suited if I wanted to do a PhD/work overseas. But then again, I've been told it doesn't matter by different research students.

This seems a bit rambly and like a lame question to ask, but I'm just not sure as to which one I should try complete. Does anyone have advice/knowledge on whether universities care if people follow the bolonga model or is it just a much of a muchness to have either an honours/masters?

So funny enough a couple of toxic cationic metals are also GSK3 inhibitors, like mercury, which could make it useful in Alzheimer disease prevention in theory.

Yesterday I got into an argument with my uncle. I used juice of a fresh lemon to mix with water. He complained and began making pestilent comments about me being a ""Diva"" because there was a plate with two (thin) lemon slices that had been sitting on the kitchen counter overnight. They were dry, brown and shriveled due to. We got into a fight because I didn't want to use them. This is because usually when using old lemon slices to mix only with water the juice gets a really bitter taste, or at least it seems so for me. Usually I use them up when cooking, because then the taste mixes with other flavours, not only water which has no flavour to begin with and thus bitterness is more notable. 

My question is, what exactly happens when lemon slices are left overnight?  I doubt in such short time there is already microbial activity due to the high content of ascorbic acid. I tried to do research, only found out that the white mesocarp of lemons contains hesperidin which is a glycoside that has a bitter flavour which only gets stronger when it is left to oxidise.

It is a horrible chemical weapon that was used in the Syrian civil war in 2013. It is so devastating since it causes muscles to stop contracting in the body. For example  when certain organs like the lungs will stop functioning, the body will go in a state of respiratory failure (also including other organs with muscles where contraction is required).

Sarin like other nerve agents will target an enzyme within the body's neuromuscular junctions (basically where the nerves meet with the muscles). The Enzyme being targeted is Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) which deactivates the nerve signaling molecule known as acetylcholine (ACh) preventing it to build up. Though the problem is that sarin will block AChE leading to acetylcholine to build up in ones muscles and continuously stimulate nerve cell receptors. Overall this will result in paralysis.

Biochemistry,"This is something that has sparked some debate within my study group.

During a lecture we were told that there are **two** main pathways by which pyruvate-carbons enter the TCA, but that the reaction requires **three** enzymes. We're fairly sure the pathways are pyruvate to oxaloacetate (pyruvate carboxylase) and pyruvate to acetyl-CoA (PDH). By extension, the three enzymes don't imply E1, E2, E3 of PDH. I proposed to my group that it is citrate synthase as acetyl-CoA isn't technically a TCA intermediate and as such, it hasn't entered the cycle yet. Furthermore it falls within the 'pyruvate to acetyl-CoA'-pathway. 

The only reason we're in doubt is because a test that came later signified that the three enzymes each have coenzymes. We're able to deduce the coenzymes for pyruvate carboxylase and PDH, however, citrate synthase doesn't have a coenzyme (that we know of) and thus we're unsure as to whether citrate synthase is infact the third enzyme. We postulated whether it was related to PEP, malate dehydrogenase or perhaps malic enzyme. The only one we really considered was malic enzyme because of its direct transition from pyruvate to malate, however, this would imply a 3rd pathway. Additionally, this does not seem like a primary pathway unlike that of the former. Is there even a 3rd enzyme..?

We sent a mail to our profressor but it's unlikely that we'll get a response anytime soon. Perhaps you guys have some insight",Are there two or three enzymes involved in the two main pathways for entry of pyruvate-carbons into the TCA?

1. I have been working 75 hours bi weekly and only getting paid for the 75 hours only.¬† 
2. For the past 4 years; I have been working extra hours every week and more than 80% of my weekends of the year. Never getting paid for this extra times.¬†

I was always taught that the mechanism by which blowing off less/more CO2 helps to neutralise derangements in pH was by Le Chaltier's principle: in this case, as more CO2 is removed, the above reaction is driven towards the left to replace the ""lost"" CO2 and in the process of doing so consumes H+, thereby raising the pH. However, as I look at it again, it strikes me that this process consumes just as many moles of HCO3- as it does H+.

Biochemistry,"Hey there,

&amp;#x200B;

(I¬¥m sorry if this is not the right place to post this)

&amp;#x200B;

So, lately I¬¥ve been thinking of putting up educational material on the internet about chemistry and biology. I¬¥d like to do it in an online-class sort of way, where I present and explain topics related to these subjects. I would want to do it in a specific order, as in, starting off from the basis and introduction to chemistry, and then going deeper, teaching topics like pH/acids &amp; bases, nomenclature, stoichiometry, and so on. Same with biology, starting off from the bottom, and then diving into the subject with diverse topics, like cell signaling, (onco)genes, proteins and biomolecules, and so on.

&amp;#x200B;

My doubt is, how should I begin with this? I thought maybe uploading educational videos to Youtube, but there\`s already Khan Academy, and other popular channels that have covered these same topics. Maybe creating a Website would be better? 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, I just wanted some input on it, and if anyone has any ideas/tips, I¬¥d really appreciate it.

Biochemistry,"I was recently looking up some data about exosome cargo, and [this database](http://www.exocarta.org/) had an extensive listing of various proteins within various exosomes coming from various cell types. Every cell type had a few hundred proteins associated with its respective exosome cargo. Some had over a thousand proteins. 

Here is my questions: 

1. How do scientists differentiate these proteins? When an exosome has a cargo load of over 500 proteins, each with its own molecular weight, wouldn't the gel just look like one big fucking smear? How do scientists actually say, ok this protein is X and this protein is Y and this protein is Z and so on? 

2. How can scientists actually be sure that a given protein is specific to a given exosome cell type? The sheer number of protein cargo held in any one exosome makes me wonder, with this much ""noise"", how do they REALLY know that a protein came from say a B-Cell exosome versus a contaminant? 

3. Is it possible that cargo varies from batch-to-batch, depending on growth environment? 

4. How can scientists be sure that the exosomes obtained from human samples are from those cell types which they're claiming to be?

And stem cells need to be injected separately via arm? The signaling chemicals would be converted from blood.

The nanobots would know their position relative to the leg-end by measuring magnetic navigation signals emitted by a device placed around the leg-end. Each nanobot would need to compute some magnetic-field vector math with tiny electronics within. That same magnetic device can also transmit / broadcast a rough map for each new part that is to be done, which the nanobots can store in their non-volatile memory and decide movements based on it. Each nanobot would have - very roughly speaking - commodore 64 levels of computing power and data storage.

For a long time I have thought I wanted to go to medical school and there are a lot of reasons that that still appeals to me. However, I've come to the realization that what I really love is science on the molecular level. I love signaling cascades, metabolism, the regulatory systems of immunology, etc etc. I love the complexity of the human body on the molecular level. I love the way that these incredible systems of self-regulation and feedback have developed through evolution to create everything that our body does. I could go on and on.

You get pieces of that with medicine and to some degree I think I could find a very fulfilling career in medicine.

BUT, I start to get a little lost when I start to think about the jobs after getting a PhD. It seems to me that the two main directions are academia and research. The idea of being a PI and playing the ""grant chasing game"" is made out to sound pretty horrible and I don't think that life is for me.  I really like talking about and discussing abstract ideas. I love the critical thinking aspect of science. I just don't known if I want to always be working toward and thinking about my next grant. 

I'm not closed off to the idea of academia, but I have been told by two close family friends that being professor (both are college professors in the chemistry) is a lot of work for not a lot of money and that they wouldn't recommend it.

1) What are some other professions and positions that I may not considering that might also appeal to me?

So really we only need 64 tRNA genes minimum, right? Why do we have so many? Is it because we need a lot of tRNA being transcribed at once? Does the incoming tRNA also have to be specifically compatible with the previous one that's still in the ribosome to facilitate a specific peptide bond creation between each different amino acid?

Biochemistry,"Hello people,

For my high school (IB) chemistry class, I've been tasked with doing a self-designed/carried-out laboratory investigation regarding a topic I'm interested in. Although I already have ideas for simple labs I could do, I've been interested in doing an investigation into a biochem topic, although it might be out of my league for high school chemistry. I've looked around on the idea of titrating amino acids and I think I conceptually understand the process and the reason behind the results. I'm not too clear as to the details and nuances of the procedure, so I was wondering if anyone could provide some clarity with that.

As I understand it, the amino acid is titrated with a strong base, which in my case would be a hydroxide. I have read somewhere though, that the amino acid must first be prepared in an acidic environment, like 0.1M HCl, to force a certain protonization of the carboxyl and amine groups. If this is the case, wouldn't one then just be titrating the acid it's prepared in, rather than the amino acid? 

I'm not even sure if I'm conceptually understanding this stuff correctly. I'm very interested in doing a lab related to titrating amino acids and am willing to go the extra mile to learn more stuff. Despite this, I understand if the topic is simply too high above my pay-grade for my knowledge of chemistry. Could one of you fine folks help bring some clarity to my situation?

Biochemistry,"Kind of a long shot, I apologize.

Minoxidil suppressed AR (androgen-receptor) related functions by decreasing AR transcriptional activity in reporter assays, reducing expression of AR targets at the protein level, and suppressing AR-positive LNCaP cell growth. It does this by with AR-peptide, AR-coregulator, and AR N/C-terminal interactions, as well as AR protein stability.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4039155/ This has implications in supressing DHT and hairloss.

This is not the only cell Minoxidil can do this too, either. It also does this to [Fibroblasts](https://iovs.arvojournals.org/data/journals/iovs/933397/567.pdf) and many other cells that aren't of concern to me for this question.

These side effects persist after the removal of Minoxidil from the medium. It permanently downregulates cell function and proliferation in all cells it touches.

My question is, how can such a strong antiproliferative be sold en masse like Minoxidil is? This is NOT an over the counter medication, you can buy this off the shelf of Walmart and order it on Amazon any time. I have used Minoxidil for 6 months, and took it orally. Since then, I have had no libido, ""dead"" looking skin, and a decrease in all hormones in my system. Nothing feels good anymore. I have no dopamine, I have no libido, my collagen is gone completely. I feel older. I'm tracking my recovery with my doctor and the results are depressing - there hasn't been any signs of recovery in the 6 months I've been off the drug.

*Would there be any ways of reversing the antiproliferative effects on Minoxidil?* I am not skilled enough in the field of biochemistry to know this myself. You can read the study above and see the means of the effects, it is quite detailed.

I believe in free education and so would like to create an online resource (apart from the book that I am planning to publish within a year or so) as well that teaches practical crystallography, structural biology, etc. I am in the process of adding some pages to my website now that I will share with everyone once it is complete and has gone through some testing. 

I was hoping to reach out to this community and see what kinds of topics people wish they understood better -- as I would like to write about and research things that will be most valuable to others. Right now I have ten topics in the making, but would love to hear what you think I should add.

2. Purification of protein for crystallography
3. Setting up crystallization experiments
4. Differentiation salt crystals from protein crystals
5. Optimizing protein crystal hits (seeding, etc.) and rescuing failed screens
6. Preparing crystals for diffraction experiments
7. Carrying out diffraction experiments
8. Understanding the diffraction pattern, and solving the phase problem
9. Understanding the Fourier transform (1D, 2D, and 3D) and its infinite uses

Like other animals, ants have structures and mechanisms that defend them from attack. Wood ants live in colonies of hundreds or thousands, and the colony as a whole has a particularly effective way of dealing with enemies. When threatened from above, the ants shoot volleys of formic acid into the air from their abdomens, and the acid bombards the potential predator, such as a hungry bird. Formic acid is produced by many species of ants and in fact got its name from the Latin word for ant, *formica*. For quite a few ant species, the formic acid isn‚Äôt shot out, but probably serves as a disinfectant that protects the ants against microbial parasites. Scientists have long known that chemicals play a major role in insect communication, the attraction of mates, and defense against predators. Research on ants and other insects is a good example of how relevant chemistry is to the study of life. Unlike college courses, nature is not neatly packaged into individual sciences‚Äîbiology, chemistry, physics, and so forth. Biologists specialize in the study of life, but organisms and their environments are natural systems to which the concepts of chemistry and physics apply.

Biochemistry,"This whole post rests on the idea that Communism doesn‚Äôt kill innovation, to which I have some counter-questions:

I‚Äôve looked at the faculty pages in Cuba‚Äôs top universities, and I must say that I am unimpressed. This isn't based only on citations but also on my taste for this because I am an expert who has spent the last few years at top American institutes in medical research, and I know what promising research looks like. [This article](https://www.nature.com/news/can-cuban-science-go-global-1.20694)claims Cuba punches above its weight, but I am in a prostate cancer lab, and I don't think their cancer vaccine is such an impressive idea, it is just targeting EGF with antibodies. Which is nice but isn't an innovation. And clinical trials are not at all conclusive about this yet. This is just noise.

Infant screening is nice, but this isn't scientific innovation. I can't think of any drugs developed by Cubans that patients are being prescribed. Successful drug development research for cancer looks like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Sawyers. An actual first-line medicine for castration-resistant prostate cancer. Find me a Cuban scientist whose work comes even close on quality or impact.

Research jobs pay poorly in the US too. Problems with basic necessities like the internet complicate things, especially considering sanctions.

My main take is: What research coming out of Cuba is ""world-leading"" in any respect? Even in consideration for any significant scientific award? They have maybe a couple of world-class scientists. Because I can name many Europeans and Chinese and Japanese and Americans but can't think of more than a couple of Cuban scientists that have had a significant impact on science. And I know a lot of science. 

Also: There is an apparent correlation between citations and innovation. Highly innovative science spins off entire new fields of study and is highly cited. I mention the scale of biotech innovation in the US because it is ridiculous to me who has seen the massive scale and insane quality of research in Boston and the level of expertise there.

The correlation between cited papers and innovations can best be explained through innovative research (when it is useful or important) and gets cited a lot because it leads to a lot of progress. A lot of people use it or are interested in it for its innovations. If it‚Äôs a breakthrough, scientists will say wow a breakthrough; then people will use it and cite it.  Of course, some innovative work is overlooked, but you can always point to it and show its value.",Regarding the claim that Cuba is leading the world in biochemical innovations..

Considering that (i) the mix I have prepared for the electrophoresis is composed of 1 ¬µL of loading buffer, 3 ¬µL of water and 2 ¬µL of DNA (so, a 1:3 dilution) and (ii) I have introduced 5 ¬µL of the mix into the gel, I have the following questions:

‚Ä¢The DNA Mass units are listed as DNA ng/5 ¬µL; does those 5 ¬µL refer to undiluted DNA volume (i.e directly taken from the PCR reaction) or to the diluted electrophoresis mix I prepared?
‚Ä¢If it makes reference to the volume of the mix, would the following estimations be correct?

-The intensity of my DNA band approximately indicates that there are 100 ng/5 ¬µL, so in my original 6 ¬µL mix I would have a DNA concentration of 20 ng/¬µL.
-Considering that it has been diluted three times, my DNA concentration on my PCR amplification would be 60 ng/¬µL. 

I have been told by a professor that I should take the direct value of only ng I get from the ladder and divide it by the number of DNA ¬µL that were in the electrophoresis gel (such as: 100 ng/2 ¬µL = 50 ng/¬µL), but I believe it makes no sense.

This glass tube is connected to another glass tube of about half a cm in diameter via a tiny rubber hose.

Biochemistry,"My professor does not think that ATP can inhibit citrate synthase allosterically. He says that it is questionable and may be dependent of specific cell types. I've found several sources that point out that it can inhibit the enzyme but he said that it does not explain why citrate is accumulated when ATP is abundant. Does citrate accumulate when ATP is abundant? 

We know that ATP also inhibits isocitrate dehydrogenase. When inhibited, isocitrate accumulates and shifts the equilibrium to form more citrate.

If citrate synthase is inhibited by ATP at the same time, then citrate production is decreased. 

If citrate can't be inhibited by ATP, then citrate would continue to form. If citrate is accumulated, then citrate lyase would degrade citrate, thus reducing its amount anyways. 

So how would citrate be accumulated when ATP is abundant?",Is citrate synthase inhibited by ATP allosterically?

Hi Scientists,

I am looking to purify HIV neutralizing antibodies from human plasma using a protein A spin column kit (cosmo bio). The kit can only purify up to 0.4 mg of IgG. Other relevant information such as the binding and elution pH is not provided by the manufacturer.

To avoid overloading my column, I use 100 uL of plasma for IgG purification. However, the neutralizing ability of the subsequent IgG is very low relative to that of unfractionated plasma. I have checked the plasma flowthrough for any neutralization activity but there's none. I have also tried dialysis against PBS to no avail.

The glycogen is broken down mainly in the liver but since you are lacking Glucose 6-Phosphatase you cannot convert G6P into glucose which can leave the liver and enter the bloodstream. This leads to Hypoglycemia. But the part that doesn‚Äôt make sense is why we are getting a build up of glycogen.

And while everything seems fine (I have a pretty damn straight  standard, my samples appear to also be within this standard) when I add my calculated 40ug of protein to my western well I get actin bands from hell... one will be twice the size of the other, and another will just be a small sliver. I've even confirmed that it is the concentration with a GAPDH blot that looks the same. 

I'm not sure what I am doing to cause it to so wildly not match up. Any clue what I'm doing wrong?",Why isn't my BCA concentrations matching my actin blots?? This is supposed to be easy!

Biochemistry," **(tl;dr: refused to pay more money for a masters to get more lab/ research experience, instead joined a ""DIY biolab"" which allows me to practice my wet lab skills but am not sure this would be considered relevant experience to get onto a PhD program.** 

Hi guys,

I am a recently graduated (July 2019) Biochemistry student from a UK university. I really enjoyed my final year undergraduate project, however I didn't want to take more loans out and pay to get more lab experience, so ultimately I decided not to persue a masters, and attempted to secure a research lab tech or assistant job where I could have utilised and practised my technical wet lab skills, then apply for a PhD. However I've been losing out to other applicants who have been lab techs for so many years, so have been a bit frustrated I can't get the lab experience I desperately want.

To compensate for my inability to get a job, I joined a ""DIY biolab"", so I could practice my wet lab skills I acquired during my undergraduate project (molecular biology and microbiology related). However the project I am working on currently is essentially an extension of my undergrad project (making cyanobacterium knockout mutants that lack genes which regulate motility) and isn't really new or novel in anyway. But I am essentially a PI of my own project, so I am solely responsible for obtaining everything I'll need to make these mutants ( restriction enzymes, ligases, plasmids, WT cyanobacteria , competent E.coli, antibiotics etc etc) and have made some progress in making these mutants, and troubleshooting experiments when they go wrong by myself. Thats why I think this is somewhat a unique and potentially good experience.

The PhD program I like to apply to is in the USA (UoA ABBS program), and am applying there because of a specific academic who has really interesting research I'd like to get involved in. The project I am working on in this DIY lab isn't at all related to the academic work, but some of the skills like gene cloning, expression and characterisation, which I am using now and have a good understanding of would be applicable.

So right now, while doing this lab project at the DIY lab, I am also filling out my application for the PhD program I'd like to get onto, and reading the relevant literature of the academic I'd like to work with. However, I am not sure if this lab project I am working on currently would be deemed enough to be considered ""research experience"" at all, and am now worried I am wasting my time here in this DIY lab.

Biochemistry,"Hi everyone,

So while it is a few months away, I decided to start thinking about my 12th grade schedule. With the way my schedule will work out, I can Most Likely only take either AP Bio or AP Chem. I was wondering if anyone here took either/both of them, which of them helped more in college? I am very interested in majoring in Biochemistry, and I just wanted to hear another opinion. 

I‚Äôm leaning towards doing AP Chemistry. While AP Bio would be great, it‚Äôs more about memorization.

Biochemistry,"This is pretty weird, but hear me out.

I'm interested in natural inks and dyes, particularly improving natural materials (e.g. increasing lightfastness) with very simple procedures and commonly available materials. What got me thinking about this is the fact that chlorophyll can be converted into copper (or zinc, or iron) chlorophyllin, by acidifying a solution and then applying an aqueous salt solution such as copper sulfate. In this way, the central magnesium ion is replaced by the copper (zinc, etc.). It's a standard commercial technique, and it has led to a product which is now used as a stable, relatively lightfast food coloring--outside the USA, anyway.

This  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/23zk2o/broadedge\_bloodink/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/23zk2o/broadedge_bloodink/)  and this  [https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/23ixoc/using\_my\_blood\_as\_ink/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/23ixoc/using_my_blood_as_ink/) show someone using blood as ink. It dries to a brown, unfortunately, and this person (/u/ThenWhenceComethEvil) had to first coagulate and then skim the blood before using it. (They also diluted it in water and used some alcohol as a preservative/deodorant.)

However, I understand that hemoglobin is quite structurally similar to chlorophyll. It can be degraded to proto-porphyrin (the central iron removed) under highly acidic and anaerobic conditions ([https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1198443/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1198443/) ) ; furthermore it can be converted into the artificial heme analogue coboglobin under certain conditions referenced briefly in this article  [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ee6e/f6ae9886d16dff93329aa1bfcfe6658bfa57.pdf](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ee6e/f6ae9886d16dff93329aa1bfcfe6658bfa57.pdf) , by replacing the iron with cobalt. Finally, I know that zinc protoporphyrin is another example of this replacement process--but this occurs naturally, proceeding in this case from myoglobin in muscle tissue under certain meat-curing conditions. And it is a bright red, relatively lightfast pigment.

I've found people on the internet who regularly (?) write with blood, for whatever reason, and simply use an anticoagulant like EDTA. So that solves the coagulation problem.

But, what I'm looking for is a process to  transform \*hemoglobin\* in the blood into zinc protoporphyrin. Ideally this would a) use the whole blood, without any separation; b) use non-exotic materials as much as possible (no carcinogens or expensive enzymes); and c) take place all in the same pot, as it were.

My thinking: 1) Acidify the blood (this could possibly be both the anticoagulant step and the iron removal step simultaneously, depending on what acid is used); 2) add an excess of a zinc salt of some kind; 3) basify the solution again and let the zinc migrate into the porphyrin.

Does this make any sense? My research is hampered by the fact that most articles on blood chemistry are (sensibly) talking about the biological activity going on in there. Very few are about manipulating blood for its, ahem, secondary properties.

Also, I am not a chemist, I am an artist, but this seemed like the best place to ask, once I'd done the legwork that I was able to do.

\- Predicted GPA when I graduate is around 3.5; I have 2 minors (foreign language + misc humanities) that don't really apply to my major.  
\- I used to be pre-med, but now I'm just on the biochemistry track. I don't really have the passion to go to medical school and doubt that I would excel there if I did chose to go to one.  
\- Right now, I think I want to go to grad school, but I'm not sure what I should try to go for. I love biochemistry, but I also love chemistry, microbiology, genetics, food science, and much more!

Since all stem cells are copies of each other, eventually there will be no more stem cells that have telomeres, and all of our cells will be degraded.

I have meniere's so i get extremely bad dizzy spells. i opted to have my vestibular system in both ears removed, but since the referral for surgery i accidentally came across a news article on SIDs saying how you need vestibular hair cells to be able to breathe during sleep. the scientist's name was Reubens and he said the hair cells in your vestibular part of the ear detect CO2 and tell your body to breathe and if both vestibulars in the ear are damaged, there will be no or very little response to CO2, and he said people with damaged vestibular hair cells could stop breathing in their sleep. this worried me a lot. the study was done on mice but a review said the experiment also damaged the mice's brains so i am unsure if it was damage to the brains causing the results of the study or chemical removal of their vestibular system.

a follow up paper said mice with damaged ears lost 60% of their respiratory drive to CO2, meaning 60% of the cells responsible for telling the body to breathe were gone. The scientist concluded unexplained deaths during sleep were people forgetting to breathe due to inner ear damage, since the inner ear is the main part of the body that tells us to breathe, and not the brainstem, and the brainstem alone cannot stop the person having fatal breathing difficulties during sleep.

I'm a electronics engineer and in a previous life a Environmental Scienctist.

Working on a project the other day an idea came to me, but I don't have the knoweldge to say whether it would be of any use. But I believe (given more thought from those in know), it would be possible to write a program that would determine on a theoretical level a way to synthesise (I think that's the right word) all Bio-chemical compounds.

Now I'm not sure that there's is a demand for something like this, or if it would even be popular or of any use at all really. But In my mind it seems perfect possible, given that synthesis in chemistry are like algorithms in math/comp sci, where if a computer were given a set of given rules and allowed to simply process those rules, it would over a long series of iterations, pump out all know potential methods, compounds, molecules, etc....

I am currently taking microbiology and we are on our metabolism unit. When we were talking about glycolysis our professor said that the first steps of glycolysis that convert glucose to glucose-6-phosphate through taking a phosphate group from atp, leaving an adp molecule is called substrate level phosphorylation. But as I am reading the chapter it says that substrate level phosphorylation is the creation of ATP from a phosphate transfer from an organic molecule to ADP.

Biochemistry,"Hi BIOC redditors,

I started off this major with the intention of becoming a doctor someday. I decided on taking this major because I was good at biology in high school, okay in chemistry,  but garbage at physics. I didn't really give it some thought, all I knew is i wanted to become a doctor because of how prestige the title is. Being the naive teen at the time I didn't realize how it would affect my mental negatively. Starting off the first two years were just a complete mess for me. I was immature and stupid, instead of studying I played video games and barely scrapped by in my classes with grades of D's and C's. My parents being Asian didn't fit in the stereotype of forcing me to become a doctor. They just wanted me to be happy and they'll be happy. So a lot of my mistakes and stupidity were all on me. I eventually realized that a lot of the information I lacked in my first two years of college are starting to take a toll in me understanding relevant information in my junior classes. But the theories and information in class are interesting to learn. But I extremely hate the lab portion of the courses as well as being extremely incompetent. I can barely do simple dilutions sometimes and I can't even follow simple directives. Now I feel like I've hemmed myself. I get very tense and stressful and unhappy every time I have to do a lab experiment. With does labs I have to write lab reports of 1-15 pages every week  which doesn't excite me either. I'm not necessarily running away from ""hard tasks"". But it made realize that even getting a job opportunity in this field requires so much lab/research experience and a Mcs or PHD.  HOW AM I GOING TO DO ANYTHING WITH THIS FIELD IF I ALREADY FOUND OUT I HATE DOING LABS? Now i'm daunting what my future prospects will be since my hatred and regrets grows every single day i spend in this major.

What do you guys think? I was thinking of just changing my major to comp sci with a fresh start. Leaving biochemistry and the life sciences for good. I've taken a college level comp sci class. Did well A- but I didn't love it nor did I hate it. Money is on me my parents wallets won't be touched with this new start. But that being said another 3-4 years of school to go through. But once I've obtained enough internships maybe I can get a decent entry level job and work my up from there. If I continue with BIOC I can graduate in 2 years try to do a masters and/or PHD and maybe apply for med school later on. How well I will do in graduate school(If i make it) is very questionable since I dread labs in this field. 

Should I stop making excuses and continue with this major since I'm already starting third year and see if it will grow on me? Or just go with my gut/extinct and take comp sci? I know the decision has to be made by me, but I'm just extremely lost. I really need some insight. 

**Tldr;** Wanted to become a doctor but that's almost impossible since I don't have the gpa, passion for the course, can't even deal with lab portions, but enjoy class lectures. Getting job opportunities requires lab experience which I don't have nor want to do. Seeing myself sitting in a lab as a career doesn't seem appetizing. Thinking of going into computer science. Fresh start with a new perspective and motivation. I had tried Comp sci and know what its like. But that is another 4 year program.

I'm trying to understand how carrying out quenching experiments using the Stern-Volmer relationship can reveal whether the quenching of a flourophore was dynamic or static.

The paper I'm reading states shows that in the Stern Volmer plot (quantum yield against \[Q\]) the Ksv values were decreased when the experiment was repeated with increased temperature. This was taken as evidence that the quenching was static.

My question is how does decreasing stern volmer constants at higher temperatures provide evidence of static quenching? If the quenching is static, that means the quantum yield is equal to  F0/F = 1 + Ka\[Q\], which makes me more confused... Why would increasing the temperature decrease the Ka (association constant)?

Biochemistry,"Hello, I apologize ahead of time, this is going to be a very long post. I will have a tldr at the bottom. Basically, I am going to talk about my background for undergrad, the choice to apply for Masters and why I want to do the PhD and with questions/concerns I have to trying to switch which is where I hope the subreddit community can help me ( I will keep everything location wise as vague as possible obviously). I have been meaning to write this post for over 3 weeks but just keep forgetting to.

So firstly, as the title states I am currently a Master's student in Chemistry. I did my undergraduate in Chemistry with a focus in biological chemistry and a Business Management Minor. That was fine for the most part except for my last two semesters of undergrad research wise and grade wise. Firstly, I did ""research"" my junior year by working up data from a previous student's RUI. Sadly, I did not get the chance to work hands on in the lab that year. My PI was very helpful in finding another professor in the department that had space to actually work in for my senior thesis. The project simply to test conditions to apply a copolymer for solid phase peptide synthesis. However, the greatest issue was that the graduate student I was going to work with was towards the end of their thesis so he was writing for the majority of the year. So basically I was rather unguided, there was a graduate student and postdoc working with similar polymers however between a lack of communication skills and not understanding how to approach the problem efficiently. It leads to a very inefficient senior thesis where I struggled deeply to produce any data and struggle with following the starting material 10 day protocol for basically the entirety of the school year. Couple that with undergrad thinking of not being to approach the PI about these issues early enough in the year besides monthly project meeting. (To be fair, I am not bashing on not receiving help during that time. It is more my own fault for taking the first approach to get help the correct way and interacting with the graduate students more to demonstrate my issues and get their help efficient. Also my issue with not being to tell the PI early enough of my issues and that I really need the assistance of the graduate student on the project and try to work a week or two where he couldn't written less and we worked side by side with him showing the techniques would have been the world of difference and also with the thought process of ""Oh I will get it if I do it enough"" which is not the way at all to approach bench work.)

Now I said Research and Grade Wise, so I unfortunately was unable to complete my Bachelor of Science due to 1 class needed for my biological chemistry requirement of my degree. Now, there is obviously seniortisis involved however that is the end of the world upon grades if you can devote more time to studying when you really need to. I was a part of two ponzi schemes at the same time during my last semester of undergrad. One of them reached out to me through the school and the other through Linkedin. Now to give a bit detail as the last couple of sentences have been packed. From one of classes, a student reached out a summer opportunity, now I have been looking religiously for summer internships/RUIs while my grades are not the highest thing you ever saw, I have a ton of Leadership experience as the President of my chemistry coed fraternity and Vice President of the ACS Undergrad Club. This doesn't make this search any less grueling and soul sucking. So seeing any of the keywords, opportunity made alarm bells go in my head and pursue them. So to save space, I was basically involved in both at the same time, now one thing about ponzi schemes to understand is that they consume a soul crushing amount of time, now couple with a senior undergrad with 2 classes and research, it becomes a couple more things to juggle and as dumb undergrads do, you pursue the real world opportunities more as you have not been hit with the real world yet so it seems more easy. That is where I was brutally proven wrong and exited both of them in roughly the same time but the damage had already been done sadly. I had committed so many hours to pointless seminars, expenses, etc. That I had done poorly in my classes and below the passing amount for the one last class that I needed to graduate and lost so much time that I could have used to properly work on my senior thesis and learn more bench work that I just wasted as a meaningless slot in my resume. Now I had already applied to walk and the whole shebang and there is no way I can have this ruin my graduation and future studies. So I signed to take the course over the summer. However, storms come in waves. That entire summer in addition to being jobless at home was when I first had internal hermarriods and basically was in bed for weeks. This coupled with my cockiness of ""Oh, I took this class last semester, I will be fine and can just study those notes more"" This lead to the sad realization of summer classes are taught differently and I again did not receive the passing grade that I needed. Now this is where full on panic mode arises as the obvious issue and additionally it was not something I could bring up to my parents. So I had to do the next best thing than delaying graduate school a year and downgrade to the Bachelor of Arts and send it to my Masters school.

Now that is last year of undergrad and summer before the Masters. When choosing this decision, my goal was to apply to either a Professional Masters to get more of the industry feeling or a traditional Masters with areas of interest. When I initially entered my undergrad, I wanted to pursue a medical degree but as my degree went on and on, I learned that in addition to that environment not being that I would thrive it, it is not something I could envision myself happily for the future. I did know that I enjoy the problem solving area of chemistry involved with biological systems to put it briefly. So that is something I want to work and let to choosing the traditional Masters location. I wanted this to be a stepping stone for me on whether bench work is the way that I should go along with networking, and planning to actually do lab work.

Now the first semester while we waited to decide what labs to join. I will talk the classes that I was taking. So for my specific Masters which is more biological chemistry orientated will be a total of 8 classes with 2 being seminars and 2 additional classes as Research credit. Now my first semester, I was living in a grad housing through the school, this house was a 9 bedroom home with only 4 people living in. So, it was always quiet but I had no direct social circles to interact with which was rather lonely outside of grad school. I had a relapse of the herrmoids again and had to take a ton of medication throughout the winter to solve the issues. Additionally, for my undergrad I lived 2 hour away from home whereas now I live 3 states away from my family which is big part of life. So this lead to a great deal of sadness and disgusting amount of dis care for learning. Now if this was coming from a lack of belief in myself to learn about what had happened to that one classes, a lack of care, etc. I don't know exactly. So when it came to deciding what group to join, I had my top 3 which all working of different areas of biochem and different lab culture but I was fine with any of them. I ended up getting into my second choice which was still fine as the work and group were very fitting. When meeting the PI's, I made sure to bring up the experiences from undergrad for research of how much I was lacking a guide and that is something I am looking for, while it is not suppose to be hand holding through experiments, there will be need to be some work as my bench experience can only be described as dismal. So I am mainly looking for a PI that will be active enough to bring up issues to and call me out on things I need to work on. As well as looking for a group that is much smaller than previously that seem like nice people as well works well with other. So to summarize the first semester because it is written all over the place and probably difficult to follow. I was very impractical to learning again (not studying accordingly, etc), didn't interact much with people, did find a PI/group that should work for what I want to gain.

So, spring semester rolls around and that doesn't come away without any issues. So a major improvement is getting into a hobby to spend my time on and make acquaintances, however during the spring semester there were points where I would focus more on the hobbies rather on school work. This demonstrated again in my general sub par attitude towards class still but not pushing forward to give my best effort. Additionally, I started working in the lab under a graduate student with about a year left. It was a initially grind to catch up to speed with how all the protocols, etc function in the lab. That was not a issue compared to when I was working on my project which is assay based and I was having difficulties to follow through my assesses and get the correct results for even the positive control. My brain automatically went to ""Brute Force method"" of repeating the same thing without trying to understand what is occurring at each step and just trying the same conditions again and again which what was done for the undergrad, this let to a couple of weeks of struggling to get this one thing going that halted everything else at the same time. At this point, I called myself out and went to therapy and forced myself to talk to the PI about this as well. The main takeaways I had from this was the housing I was in sucked a lot, I have a number of bad habits from doing hobbies, watching YouTube instead of working at home. My PI also obviously noticed this as my professor for the one class I am taking and as my PI this meh attitude to recommend the therapy to figure out if grad school was exactly the path I wanted to go down. I knew that I had to make a change otherwise I am just wasting everyone's time at this point.

Summer comes through, I move to a normal apartment with flatmates that I visibly can see despite working in my room mostly. I have immersed myself more with the department and hobby groups so my circles are stronger. I finally am able to get the assay up and running. There is certainty a lot less to do over the summer and allowed to focus on research more without classes. I was doing a side hustle on weekends as well as Master stipend is not a lot sadly. But it was a good summer of doing work. The end of summer is when I bought up to PI that I have been toying with the idea of the switch. I have to talked to Graduate Director on what the process would be and it is super clear. However, it will all come down to my PI and they have had me in the lab and taught 2 courses to me. So my first year was the roughest part starting for a multiple of reasons Now, the biggest unknown area of me to the PI is Independence which falls under a umbrella of things from Literature Search, Writing, independent thinking, etc. However it was not a outright No. While I have gotten a lot of work done over the summer, it is kinda of where I should have been already as a Masters student much earlier if it wasn't for all the issues that I was having in the Spring. So obviously there is a much larger amount of things expected from the PhD to the Masters so despite having the jump in progress, it only brings me to where I should have been to begin with. And that even more improvement needed to switch over is nothing that is seen often.

Now Fall starts like 3 weeks ago. So, currently I am in classes again along Research and TA. I still am finding a balance to plan out experiments with the new schedule and making sure that I work on my mini meeting longer than a hour or two that has happened the past two meetings. The current issues that plague me is since that discussion with the PI is a overwhelming pressure to not show crummy data again however since I am stilling figuring out my schedule I fail to work on my mini meetings enough which ends up having No worked data for certain things I am working on each week. I am working on a issue with producing good replicates and went back into the Brute Force Method subconsciously the past week without stopping to tackle the main problem first. Then just not initially thinking before doing experiments

To give a summary of why I am pursuing this switch. I really enjoy the area of work that the lab works in. The department while small is very welcoming overall and the rest of my year are great people as well. The other graduate students in the lab are very helpful if I come to them to with some ideas first. There are also cool people as well so it makes the lab dynamic fun and not super office like. The PI is great and is able to effectively point what needs to be worked if the some preparation is done beforehand. I feel like it would be a good environment to fully learn more bench work in a area that I will enjoy with a lab culture that fits me very well. That would be a hard thing to find again and I would never be able to live with myself if I didn't try.

To summarize what I am asking for help on after splashing this whole life summary of the past two years on here are:

1. How to develop more of the problem solving mindset that is needed to tackle problems short/long term?
2. How to get more in the habit of reading more literature? I am reading all of the previous papers in depth and only halfway through.
3. There is a good amount of this information that my PI does not know. Is it worth sharing? I don't want anything via guilt and want this with my own merit.
4. I have not yet brought this up to graduate students of the lab, while they will be my greatest resource for this, I have no idea how to initiate that conversation
5. Any other tips, tricks, suggestion you guys have?

Sorry if the last couple of paragraphs have been vague, I am not sure what exactly to explain in them.

This essay addresses inherent problems within most pharmacological and biological assays that all scientists should know. A basic scientific principle is that scientific theories are overturned by experimental evidence that doesn‚Äôt support the current theory, but this is only true if the experiments are not only accurate and repeatable, but also accurately represent the natural reactions that happen within the whole animal or organism. This is especially important in the biological and pharmacological sciences, because there are numerous variables that influence the experimental outcomes that receive little or no mention in the mainstream scientific literature. In order to develop new drugs, we need to increase our awareness of the critical variables that are seldom mentioned in most experimental assays. Many of these factors may be why assays are often difficult or impossible to reproduce. When we look at the bigger picture, it is a wonder that we place so much trust in our assays for the important roles that they play in everything from drug development to medicine and research. To step back and see this bigger picture, I will briefly discuss three general factors that often alter the outcomes of these assays. 

**Three Factors Complicating Most Pharmacological and Biological Assays**

**1) Confounding Effects:**

An overlooked subject that greatly influences pharmacological and biological assays is desensitization or substrate inhibition. This is observed when higher doses of drugs, ligands or substrate molecules show a decrease in the response of the receptor or activity of an enzyme. Most receptor and enzymatic reactions display some negative feedback such as desensitization or substrate inhibition. However, this often goes unnoticed because many assays measure the cumulative response, which is the area under the actual dose-response curve (or the area under the kinetic reaction curve) for different drug, ligand or substrate concentrations. Assays measuring a cumulative response mask the underlying desensitization or substrate inhibition within these systems. 

It is often, wrongly, thought that by keeping the drug or substrate molecules at lower levels the effects of desensitization or substrate inhibition will be reduced or prevented. This isn‚Äôt accurate, because the phenomena of desensitization and substrate inhibition is inherent within the chemical equilibria of these systems. Many scientists and medical doctors aren‚Äôt aware of the ubiquity of drug desensitization or enzyme substrate inhibition, because many experimental assays aren‚Äôt capable of clearly demonstrating these phenomena. These issues present a large problem in drug development and the proper pharmaceutical treatment of patients. 

Interpretation of assay results is perhaps another one of the most confounding factors. Our interpretations are largely model dependent. We tend to see what our models allow us to see. Models, such as curve fitting, often create confounding factors that are very much dependent on the assumptions underlying these models. Any two-dimensional curve can be fitted by an arbitrary polynomial to arbitrarily high powers; however, this type of fitting does little to elucidate the underlying biophysical mechanisms of these systems. Statistically we can get a good fit with a bad model. Statistics alone cannot determine the quality of our research. A good model should be like a good pair of glasses that helps us see more clearly the underlying biophysical and physicochemical mechanisms of our assays. Bad models blur our understanding and create confusion. 

Current trends using extremely simplified simulations to model and understand the reactions of enzymes or receptors may be hindering our understanding of the underlying basic principles. It seems unlikely that such relatively small differences of 2-5 kcal/mole in binding energies of drugs, ligands or substrates will produce signal-specific wiggles against the background thermal noise in these much larger molecules. Because of our limitations, our current models cannot accommodate many of the other important molecules included within these complex systems, such as the solvent, lipid, other proteins, counter-ions, redox, energy, and cofactor molecules that are necessary components for the activation of these systems in their natural state. Because these complex systems are simplified and run in a vacuum, we‚Äôre stuck trying to make sense of rather meaningless wiggles. These observations often serve to obfuscate rather than clarify our understanding of the underlying biophysical principles.  

**2) Past Histories:**

In general, assays can be divided into those using whole organisms (*in vivo*) or isolated preparations (*in vitro*), but there‚Äôs also the more general and less controlled variables of past histories and current environmental conditions surrounding these assays, which applies to both *in vivo* and *in vitro* assays. Past histories include considerations such as how the animals were handled, caged, fed, type of bedding, etc., or how the isolated preparation was prepared, such as type and amounts of buffers used, fluctuations in temperatures (and the duration and order of these fluctuations), osmotic pressures, pH, solvents; exposures to atmospheric (oxidation) conditions at what stages of the preparation and for what length of time, etc. How pure were our preparations, chemicals, buffers, solvent(s), cofactors, etc? Did the type of containment vessels (glass/plastic) alter the preparations? 

Past exposures to various exogenous (xenobiotics, pollutants) and endogenous (steroids, fatty acids) chemicals may induce metabolic pathways such as the Cytochromes P450 enzyme systems (CPYs) that handles many exogenous and endogenous molecules. These induced pathways can profoundly alter our assays in ways that we don‚Äôt currently see or understand fully.  

These factors are usually not reported in the scientific literature to the detailed extent that is necessarily suggested here. In some cases, scientists have recognized these confounding facts and tried to account for them, but in general we should all be aware of these serious problems in interpreting any experimental results. Only by recognizing these problems and the limitations that they place on our current assays can we make future progress toward a better scientific understanding of the experimentally observed responses of receptor and enzyme systems. 

**3) Assay Conditions:**

In general, the more procedures that required to isolate any biological sample, the more errors accumulate such that easy replication becomes very difficult or impossible. 

Very little or no attention is given to the REDOX (Reduction-Oxidation reactions) environment of receptors or enzymes when measuring their activities *in vitro*. *In vitro*, there is little or no regard to the possible effects of light, high oxygen (including REDOX status), electromagnetic gradients, etc. The processes of isolating receptor or enzyme molecules often exposes them to oxidation conditions that generally go unaccounted for the possible effects on their redox sensitive groups. 

The requirements of cofactors for enzyme reactions has been previously discovered, but there may be additional requirements such as the requirement for an energy source from molecules such as ATP or GTP or membrane energy gradients. Additional molecules may be necessary to sustain and regenerate these energy molecules or gradients across membranes. There may also be requirements for essential regional molecules such as gases (CO2, H2S, NO, etc.) that may have far greater tissue concentrations *in vivo* than in our *in vitro* assays. 

Another problem that may seem simple, but is quite complicated, is simply determining the pH-dependence of a receptor response, or an enzymatic reaction. Often these reactions are done at various pHs to find the optimum pH for that specific reaction under the conditions of specific temperature, pressure, osmotic pressure, etc. To complicate matters, the binding drug, ligand, or substrate molecules may have their own titratable groups that are pH-dependent that differ from the receptor or enzyme molecules, which often have multiple titratable groups that may also act to influence each other. Other problems arise because the receptor or enzyme molecules are often membrane bound *in vivo* whereas the assays are performed *in vitro*. Other significant problems, which are very difficult to accommodate into *in vitro* assays, is that biological membranes often separate regions with different pHs, counter-ion concentrations, osmolarities, etc. Even the simpler problems such as determining the proper buffer(s) to use, the concentration, temperature correction(s), unwanted effects on other molecules, such as solvent(s), cofactors, pH-detector(s), etc. are daunting. 

In general, it is also very difficult to perform assays under strictly *in vivo* conditions. The confounding problems with using the whole organism entails many additional factors that affect the experimentally measured responses, which include the pharmacokinetic factors such as the ADME (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion).  Each of the ADME factors have multiple complexities that can confound experimental observations. Just considering the distribution factor alone is often complicated by a drug, ligand, or substrate molecule having to cross one or more membrane barriers, and by the differing tortuosity of the route to tissue-embedded groups of receptor or enzyme molecules. These barriers can greatly delay or alter the drug or substrate molecules from reaching their target receptors or enzymes. The surrounding microenvironments often determine the further metabolism and replenishment rates of the drug, ligand, or substrate molecules, which are also dependent on the lipid compositions of membranes as important considerations. The correct biochemical and biophysical tensions across these membranes are also vitally important to ensure that these assays accurately reflect their natural biological activities. The correct ionic, osmotic, electrochemical, and pH gradients are the most obviously important ones, but there are many others. 

Assays that test experimental drugs for potential further drug development are perhaps one of the most critical components of the drug discovery process; yet they remain poorly characterized for this as well as for other biological purposes. This is a very general description of several problems with experimental assays that I‚Äôve noticed over the four plus decades of my career covering experimental, computational and theoretical approaches to many scientific problems. Some of these problems may seem simple but continue to remain largely marginalized and go unnoticed. They need to be recognized and openly discussed so that further progress can be made. Other problems are much more complex than current experimental techniques can handle, but knowledge of these problems may spur improved assays or at least make us aware of the many problems inherent within our current pharmacological and biological assays.

The background to my questions is this:

I was telling a friend of mine who is a professional weight lifter about how a biochemist once told me ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt lose fat weight by exercising with carbs in your diet because of insulin‚Äù and I think they may have said something about insulin stopping lipase transcription in preference to adrenaline and cortisol promoting lipase transcription or something (or maybe I misunderstood).

To do so, I am measuring the kobs (pseudo first order rate constant) of various inhibitor concentrations from progress curves. The kobs of each condition can then be plotted against the inhibitor concentration to obtain Ki and kinact. I have been doing this against several enzymes with no issue. However, in the last few experiments, the software I use to fit the curve (graphpad prism) gives me ""ambiguous"" results. Moreover, I have noticed I have obtained negative kobs for certain inhibitor concentrations and I am not sure how this is possible.

I just took my second biochemistry quiz and I am pretty upset about getting two of the questions wrong. I think that the questions are vague and misleading so I couldn't answer them properly. For the first question asking about which nucleic acids provide the key to decoding genetic information, I see how it can be tRNA but how can't it be mRNA? Without transcription, then translation doesn't even have the opportunity to work. I just think that they're equally important and you can't really separate the two like that and focus solely on one as the key.

For the second one, I don't think it is a fair question to ask because at the bottom of the purine there is that X group attached to the heterocyclic nitrogen. So, how am I supposed to distinguish if that is just a sugar or a sugar with a phosphate? I thought it would be a nucleoside since that X I figured that it was a base (adenine) and the x representing a sugar.

However I still think that with same circumstances, the one major would be better than other to getting in.

Also, in case, I will not apply the graduate school, which major would be better to find job on medical science field without Ph.D. or better to switch to other industry (like data scientists, finance sector, etc.)?

It's interesting how enzymes catalyze a multitude of reactions in our metabolic pathway, allowing reactions to occur for our bodies to maintain homeostasis. But if you could spontaneously create an enzyme with any properties (Km, active site, inhibition, cofactors, etc.), what would it entail? I know protein engineering has been increasingly prevalent over the past few years, but the discipline focuses on making proteins through rational design and directed evolution. I'm just wondering what enzyme you would make even if it isn't possible. 

I'd make an enzyme that is similar in function to RNA polymerase, but modify it so that when it proofreads RNA during transcription, it'd be less prone to errors. Its error rate is around 1 in 100,000 whereas DNA polymerase's is 1 in 100 million. This would hopefully be done with a better binding site, but I'm not sure.

Background:
I have always liked and excelled science for my whole life. I went into college knowing I wanted to pursue a science degree (chemistry, biology, something of the like) but I wasnt exactly sure what. I went through my first two years taking the courses that are common between all science majors (with the exception of engineering and physics). Last semester, it was time, according to my advisor, to declare. Honestly, I had no idea what to do. I thought to myself ‚ÄúI kinda like chemistry and I like biology. Ill just do biochemistry.‚Äù I also was thinking about money. I was told throughout my first two years that a bachelors in the biology department will lead you to a glorified minimum wage job and I wasnt sure if I wanted to go to grad school so I went the chemistry route for a better entry level job. I have since learned that a bachelors in biochemistry wont get much either.

Currently:
I started my courses that are unique to the biochemistry major and I do not like it at all. Its a snooze fest to me and I have no interest in learning the material. In my Professionalism in Chemistry class, we had to make a little name tent thing and one of the corners was ‚ÄúWhats your chemistry interest?‚Äù as in what topics do you like. I literally couldn‚Äôt think of anything. Im starting to realize that I only like chemistry because I can pass the classes and I want a decent living. I honestly like biology topics more and find them more interesting. I feel like I want to learn about biology topics more than chemistry. If i stick out the biochem degree, it may hurt my grades due to lack of interest and seeing the work as a chore. 

Question:
What should I do? Should I stick it out in hopes Ill find something I like? Should I change directions before it‚Äôs too late (Im a junior in college)? Should I be concerned about the money?

I have a need/desire to modify the amine group of an amino acid.  Just to give you an idea, say that I wanted to add an ethyl group to glycine to make N-ethylglycine.  

My orgo textbook tells me that I could expect ethyl halide to add to the amine.  But I also think that it would add to the carboxylate.  

I think that I could figure out some scheme to block the acid, add the alkyl halide, then de-block the acid.  But that seems like it might be convoluted and that there might be either a standardized way to do it or other strategies. 

I would think that modifications like this would be somewhat commonplace, but I can't seem to find much in the literature.  There are some strategies to modify proteins, but they tend to be with single modifications (and I want something fairly flexible so that I can add different groups).

2012- Get an into an undergraduate research lab, which at this point almost isn't worth mentioning because I didn't really apply myself. But otherwise I just do okay in classes. Im chugging along but still immature and naive. Was diagnosed with clinical depression and SSRI medication helped out tremendously. 

2013 - Kinda just stopped going to research. Didn't think much of it because I was slipping into a phase of hedonistic alcoholism and video game addiction. 

year of 2013-2014 semesters - literally an alcoholic and video gameaholic. Didn't go to class. dropped out but in some ways just shrugged it off. Like most of my life, I found it hard to give a fuck.

2014 - Found out that I was suffering from mild bipolar illness, and switched medications. Have remained pretty stable since. Went about my days carelessly.

&amp;#x200B;

2014-2017 - Tried finishing my degree, (with grad school still in mind) from a local university (UTPB) but dropped out for 4 consecutive semesters because I literally could not discipline myself to put in the effort.    Like having a dream and continuing to want it but making no sacrifices to push yourself to do the work. Its actually insane how stupid it sounds because I am not a stupid person. I dont have a problem understanding abstract concepts at all but I have a HUGE problem with doing things that I DONT FEEL LIKE DOING.

At this point I didnt know what the fuck I wanted out of life. I was ""happy"" because video games and the job at Barnes and Noble I enjoyed were keeping me content, but I was going nowhere fast and I didnt want to let my childhood dream of being a biochemist go. I feel like I have always been a smart person in terms of creative thinking and intellectual interest but my self discipline has been terrible. 

I literally never developed self discipline as a young person. EVERRRRR. I am 27 now and just now am I learning self-discipline because I felt like I could smart my way through everything.

 If you want to get psychoanalytically with it, you could say I am a 10 in openness to experience and a 1 in conscientiousness.

&amp;#x200B;

NOW. I am finishing my last year of my BS in Biochem online. I have a 3.6 GPA through this school and have been working very hard on trying to fix my academic record. But it seems unfixable.

&amp;#x200B;

NOW THE QUESTION: When I apply to graduate schools. should I completely leave out the UTPB transcript? It is literally 4 semesters of withdrawal. It looks terrible. I feel like there is no way in hell that any graduate school will let me in if I have my last year at Texas Tech dropout AND 4 MORE SEMESTERS of withdrawing from my local University.

But can an acceptance committee find my record? If i don't report it will I get in trouble?

Biochemistry,"Hey guys, I‚Äôm hoping someone can help me answer the following question.

I will provide some background information for context. 

I am working with iPSC stem cells, and 3D printing with cell encapsulated bio-inks. Anyways, to cross link the bio-ink we use CaCl (2% w/v) mixed in PBS. However, the CaCl doesn‚Äôt seem to mix with the PBS very well - I just end up with precipitate. I assume that this is because the hydrogen bonds are already being formed with the saline part of the PBS and thus cannot bond with the CaCl and/or that the calcium is forming Calcium Phosphate. The result of this precipitate is usually inadequate cross-linking.
To overcome this problem I started using distilled water, which allows the CaCl to mix really well. However, I am told that this will cause lysis of my cells due to osmosis, as the water will flow into the cell due to the gradient created by the salt. 
However, since I actually have CaCl in the water, would osmosis still occur in such a way that my cells would undergo lysis? Would the calcium not counter the sodium gradient?

Biochemistry,"I just began a prestigious Biochem / Structural biology doctoral program and I feel I have no idea what I'm doing. By that I mean my undergrad research was in an X-ray crystallography lab but I really only worked on expressing membrane protein constructs and no structures were produced in my short time (1 year) to get experience resolving them so it remained some far off goal. On my applications I explicitly detailed my experience and was never asked about it at interviews. I never expected to be accepted and planned to take another year to gain experience and become an attractive candidate, but when I got in I felt I had to take the opportunity. 

Currently, my first rotation has affirmed my insecurities regarding my inexperience. The lab is very structure heavy, as they study far more crystallographically amenable proteins so they produce far more structures. I feel there is an expectation to already understand everything but I feel like a complete idiot when they discuss topics from diffraction data processing to their crystallization conditions which are far different from those I'm familiar with. I'm trying to catch up but my lab mates are surprised when I mention things relating to my inexperience.

Is this unusual? The grad students I worked with and respected in undergrad said I should take the opportunity, but I'm seriously questioning my chop at this point and could use some advice from anyone who may have been in a similar spot.

Biochemistry,"So I‚Äôm just starting out with cellular respiration and we haven‚Äôt gotten into the nitty gritty of it yet. I‚Äôm trying to consolidate my understanding of the overall concept but there‚Äôs a few things I‚Äôm not sure about. This is what I currently think happens (in summary):

Food (with lots of reduced C-H bonds) reacts with oxygen, producing oxidised C-O and H-O bonds. The electrons from these bonds are transferred to NAD+ and FAD and these are reduced to NADH and FADH2. Then in a later stage NADH and FADH2 are both oxidised and give up their electrons to drive the pump that makes ATP.

Questions:

Why are the reduced C-H bonds fundamentally higher energy/release energy when broken? Is it because the electrons in the bond ‚Äúwant‚Äù to be with a more electronegative atom (O) and so give up the energy difference between their more lose C-H bond and their tight X-O bond.

Why is a tighter/stronger bond (like H-O compared to C-H) is considered to have LESS energy, if it‚Äôs harder to break.

Would it be correct to say that the C-H bond has a greater Gibbs Free Energy than the C-O/H-O bonds?",Some questions about cellular respiration

Hello all, I am a research student investigating the cytotoxicity of 10 natural products I have synthesised. I have performed the neutral red assay and have used graphpad to determine the IC50 values.

However I am particularly confused regarding the statistical testing (in organic chemistry there is a distinct lack of statistics), I have tested each compound at 4 different concentrations 3 times per plate and subsequently 3 plates per compound.

Firstly I have performed a Shapiro-Wilks test to determine whether the data is normally distributed and confirmed that it is.

Next I believe I need to perform a one-way anova and a subsequent post-hoc test. However, this is where my confusion lies, as what exactly do I input into the one-way anova? Do I calculate a mean % cell viability for each compound at each concentration and then try to perform the anova? Or do I input the repeated measurements to allow for the one-way anova?

Furthermore, how do I use graphpad to perform this test?

Biochemistry,"Hello!

&amp;#x200B;

As undergraduate student majoring in Biochemistry, I'm yet to take Organic Chemistry (among other significant courses relating to this field as well), the class that I've seen make students produce more tears than any other.  

But, this isn't intended to focus solely on Organic Chemistry, as that's just an example (of a prerequisite).  Say though, if (following Organic Chemistry) some folks had available time to spare - I don't think it'd be an infeasibility for such an individual to start learning biochemistry before the course begins.  But please feel free to tell me if you disagree....

I ask this because I'm aware of the lab portion my University's year-long biochemistry course and looking back, I recall how in General Chemistry I the Lab (in my opinion) was paramount for achieving a full understanding of the class.

So, for those who want to prepare for or simply self-educate themselves on Organic Chemistry and/or just Biochemistry - 

**How important would you consider the lab to be for these courses &amp; why?**

**So lastly, having taken these courses yourself, how would you recommend one to approach biochemistry?** 

**Most importantly, when it comes to understanding the content of these courses before actually beginning them, what do you think would be the best resources (books, websites, YouTube, online lectures, etc.) OR an ideal method for an individual to engage in?**  I imagine that biochemistry is a significantly difficult, yet, awesome course that provides an extremely valuable set of information.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

***TL;DR: I want to know if I can realistically teach myself the fundamental concepts of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry independently before I actually begin the courses so that I won't be hearing everything for the first time &amp; if this doesn't sound unrealistic to you, then I'd be very interested in resources you'd think that I could use or things that one should do for beginning their foundation?***

So I added 1% Triton X-100. However, the Triton never went into solution...it phase separated.

Biochemistry,"Which create enzymes or help transporter drugs that you take and make them work? All I can find is about Magnesium, this quote:

**''Did you know that it‚Äôs impossible to digest food without magnesium? A deficiency contributes to your digestive trouble.
Without magnesium, your body can‚Äôt perform the ‚Äúmechanics‚Äù of digestion, make hydrochloric acid (stomach acid), make digesting enzymes for carbs, proteins and fats, and repair and protect your digestive organs (esophagus, stomach, intestines, pancreas, colon). The hormones that tell your stomach to produce digestive acid need magnesium to be made; without it, you can‚Äôt digest food. After your stomach, food goes into your intestines, where more enzymes made by the pancreas break it down small enough to be absorbed as nutrients. The pancreas must have magnesium to make these vitalenzymes.''**

So, is it possible magnesium is what absorbs drugs because it creates enzymes? Or is this only enzymes for food? if not, there has to be some amino acids, vitamins, mineral or something that has a role in this perhaps indirectly by doing something? Iodine creates thyroid hormones and boosts your metabolism, could this possible have a role by boosting your metabolism you absorb drugs better? but then again your metabolism still uses some enzymes right to absorb the drugs so which could those possible be and what boosts those?

Case Study:

Company was in receivership, and they purchased an industrial Ultrasonic Desulfurization equipment that was custom built for them. According to the client, it does run some version of Windows (Probably Embeded), but he doesn't know how it programs to change certain things on it. The unit works normally, but they need to figure out how to change certain things.

Biochemistry,"Hi guys! (I‚Äôm sorry for the formatting, I‚Äôm on mobile and also super new to reddit. I‚Äôm also not paying super close attention to my grammar so I apologize in advance!) TL;DR at the bottom

I just switched schools (smaller college to big university) and also switched my major from biology to biochemistry and molecular biology. I have always had a big interest in biochem but my prior institution didn‚Äôt yet have the courses/resources to get a degree in it.

I have 75 credit hours from my previous institution so basically I‚Äôve done most of my core courses there (specifically relating to science: I‚Äôve taken the principles of bio sequence, gen chem sequence, calc I, but I‚Äôve only taken the first half of the calc-based physics so I still need to take the other one and I need to take calc II still) and I‚Äôve taken some of my major/upper classmen courses as well (genetics, cell bio, organic chem I, organic chem II, and been in two different research projects).

All of this to say, I now have all the pre-reqs to be taking the BCMB courses starting this fall at my new school. I did really well at my old school, my GPA is a 3.8 (I got a few B‚Äôs in my freshman year), but I have found out that my old school‚Äôs course rigor really isn‚Äôt up to par with what my new school‚Äôs course rigor is. All my courses transferred over directly so I had thought they were super similar but I found out that my new school posts syllabi for each course on this bulletin/forum thing. After looking at the syllabi for the courses I had received transfer credits for, I noticed that some of my courses did not go into as much depth or there were certain things that weren‚Äôt covered at all. The classes that had the most differences were math and physics. (Luckily organic seemed pretty much the same!)

So I am concerned and anxious about the whole thing. I have been playing catch up all summer long and I am making a lot of progress, but I‚Äôm still nervous. 

Do any of you have any advice for how to be prepared and stay on top of things for your biochem courses? Or any general commentary on what to expect? Since I‚Äôve already taken the organic sequences and cell bio, is biochem more of an expansion of that?

Biochemistry,"Hello everyone!

I  am in a bit of a weird situation (or at least I think it is unique!). I  am currently a biochemistry PhD student looking to ""master out"" of my  program and then joining the military. I've just completed my first year and I've done really well academically and have been promoted to higher  TA positions. And credit-wise I have one more year until I can leave  with a masters. So, things are going smooth, so far. That is, until I  have to take a preliminary exam next semester. See, here's the thing: I  haven't exactly told my PI or anyone that I want to get the masters and  bail. In our school, MS students don't have to take a preliminary exam.  PhD students who take this preliminary exam and fail,""May Continue in  the Masters program"" (as stated in the handbook). So, I am at odds as to  how to approach this situation. Hear is what I've been thinking:

Option 1: Tell my PI and PhD Committee that I want a masters. (My PI will not be very understanding.)

Option 2: Do the best job that I can on the preliminary exam and if I fail, I fail. I then continue in the masters program.

If  I do option 1, I am not sure if this would be grounds to lose my funding. Has anyone experienced failing quals/pre-liminary exams and losing your tuition waiver/funding?

If I  do option 2 and fail the exam, I am worried that they may just kick me  out of their department all together. The handbook says ""May Continue in  the Master's Program."" This could be up for interpretation.

This  has really been bothering me for long time. I haven't really been able  to get some advice from anyone. I'm worried if I go to someone in my  department or committee they will yank my funding.

Thanks! 

P.S. I love you.",Why do different sources have different AA sequences for the same protein?
Biochemistry,"Protein folding is complicated. You're supposed to start from a sequence of amino acids and end up with all the atoms in the right place. The typical approach is to consider a random starting point and then try to converge on a stable, low energy conformation which is considered folded. Because this is how they study protein folding in a lab. They heat up a protein until it's a disordered mess and then cool it off and watch it fold up again. However they do that.

And this is awesome. A magical property of proteins where most of them will end up at the correct end point pretty much regardless of where you start. So massive super computers and distributed networks use a probabilistic approach to guess a structure, check, and then try again.

The reason why they don't just throw a randomly oriented string of amino acids into a quantum mechanics or molecular dynamics optimization program is that these things tend to scale poorly as you add more atoms. And if it's a protein, we've either folded it already or it has a lot of atoms.

But remember, it doesn't really matter where we start from or how we get there, only where we end up.

If you were to consider only a few amino acids, like the start of a protein sequence, it wouldn't be that difficult to optimize the structure. Then if you added another one, what you already had was pretty much correct. So you could probably ignore all but the last one or two. And since the amino acids are pretty much the right shape to begin with, you could keep the relative positions of the atoms fixed, just leaving bond rotation. (You might even be able to get away with just having two rotation points - one on the backbone and another where the functional group attaches.)

Which is nice. It greatly reduces the degrees of freedom in a couple different directions. There may be some interactions which cause previously folded sections to move, but chances are good that it won't make a big difference if the whole protein is allowed to relax and re-optimize once it's assembled. And that's actually the process of folding within a cell (rather than a test tube). The ribosomes add amino acids one at a time and there really isn't any way (or reason) not to have them fold up along the way. Unless there are chaperone proteins to help with folding or other things like that.

This might get you close to linear time with amino acid length, which is nice. But there are still all those nifty statistical tools for predicting structure from a section of sequence. It may be possible to speed things up by adding chunks which have a structure known to be high probability and then optimizing along it.

But from a computational perspective, what would be really helpful is a simplified atomic force model for interactions between amino acids. This could be produced from the quantum mechanical model and blend the per electron wave equations. And then it's just an optimization problem in a computationally efficient spectral method type formulation. (It also helps if you grid the space, keeping track of which bin a given amino acid is to quickly select for others that are ""near"" then ignoring everything that is not.)",Protein folding primer (like you're in a hurry)

NADH+ can't even cross the inner mitochondrial membrane (although i realise there are pathways that get around this, but why even have the enzymes outside in the first place if the NADH+ can't readily get in). What is the purpose of these enzymes? 

&amp;#x200B;

I cannot seem to find any good articles. I have read some that allude to lipid synthesis and iron regulation with aconitase, but nothing very in depth. Are these enzymes primarily there for NADH+ synthesis or is it more the substrates they produce that are interesting instead?

I then drop temp of incubator to 17C for one hour (I rarely put on ice, I find I have better expression when I cool for one hour in incubator rather than flash cooling on ice for 20 min).

Biochemistry,"I just completed an undergraduate degree in Biochem (in Ottawa) and I have no idea where to go from here. I've probably read every post in here where people are also in my position and I've gathered that most people end up working in labs for biotech companies, go into research and development, go into quality assurance etc. I keep reading that its not entirely difficult to get these jobs if you have your degree and if you have some lab/research experience. The thing is the only lab experience I have is through the courses I took, I never volunteered or got paid to work in a lab.  Also, the only work experience I have is working as a barista for 3 years. 

Truthfully, I never really enjoyed being in the lab, and my favourite part of doing experiments was gathering the data, going home and making graphs/doing calculations based on the results. This leads me to believe I may be more interested in data science, perhaps bioinformatics (I actually took a bioinformatics course this year and got an A+). Although I'm a STRONG beginner in the computer software field. 

I'm currently unemployed and I have been applying to lab jobs and emphasizing my lab experience through my education but I feel like its not enough, especially since they usually require at least 1-2 years of work experience in a lab. But again, the only motive for applying to those jobs is the lab experience through school. I suppose I could contact old Professors and ask to volunteer in their labs to gain more experience, but if I don't see myself working in a lab down the road, and I can't really see myself really enjoying it I don't know if it would be worth it. Also since I graduated I feel like it may be too late? Or is working in a lab a different experience from doing one experiment in 3 hours and I'm knocking it before I try it?

Biochemistry,"Hi everyone! I am currently doing my dissertation on the design of an acoustic cell sorter and need some advice from people who use FACS in their research :)

Simply put, an acoustic cell sorter uses sound waves to sort cells by their size or density ([more info here](http://bme.lth.se/research-pages/nanobiotechnology-and-lab-on-a-chip/research/acoustophoresis/)). The advantages of this over FACS are that it is a label-free, gentle and relatively straightforward method.

My first task is to choose a specific application for the device (eg. what cells it will sort).

In order for the product to be commercially viable, it either needs to:

* be more efficient\\faster at sorting cells commonly sorted using FACS,
* sort something that FACS cannot sort easily, or
* be something that biologists will actually find useful in their research.

Some example applications are separation of blood components, separation of CTCs from blood, separation of lipids from blood etc.

Hello guys, I will try to keep this as short as possible. I've been suffering from severe Depression for more than a decade. The fatigue that goes with it kills my energy so much, that I'm struggling to sleep less than 13-15 hours each day. I have anxiety problems, I can't keep up with my work and I am feeling severely sleep deprived 24/7. I am unsympathetic with other human beings and socializing is impossible, no matter what mindest I force myself to have.

I always did everything in the book that I could do (work out 5days a week, focus on higher goals, watch my diet etc) but my physical limits cripple me way too hard. I spend most of my money on supplements, trying to find something that helps me. 

I'm a psychology student from germany and can guarantee, that there are no cognitive reasons for my depression. The problem has to be a biochemical one.

One day I was hitting the gym and noticing, that they have new booster-shots in a vendoring machine (I SUBMITTED A PICTURE WITH THE INGREDIENTS OF THE PRODUCT). I immediately noticed, how extremely well I am feeling, once I consumed a shot. Once I take a shot, I am awake, I feel lifted, ecstatic, overall just perfect.

I'm asking people with know-how to please help me find the ingredient in this product, that helps me so much. I can 100% say, that caffeine is NOT responsible for my awakeness, as I've already made my experiences with it.

I ordered N-Acetyl-Tyrosine and Beta-Alanin, hoping to find my answer in one of these two substances - with no luck.

I figured that there is Vitamin B6 in the booster, so yesterday I ordered a Vitamin B-complex from amazon, hoping that some kind of Vitamin B deficiency might be the case. But I haven't recieved my order yet, so I can't tell. I eat a lot of meat but some people say, that in some cases it doesn't prevent people from having a Vitamin B deficiency.

Biochemistry,"I have a conjecture that I haven't seen mentioned in textbooks or the flagship literature (Kendrew/Perutz, older reviews).  I was wondering if there is any literature on this topic or if anyone that has worked with Hb in the lab has any insights.  The commentary is below.  Note, I use ""saltatory"" in its literal sense (i.e., it has nothing to do directly with saltatory conduction):

The cumulative oxygen delivery to cardiac and skeletal muscle occurs in saltatory fashion with O2 passing through myoglobin as an intermediate carrier and oxygen delivery commencing only when Mb saturation has reached a threshold level.  The conduction of O2 begins with spontaneous dissociation from hemoglobin.  An increase in background pO2 results in net exchange between Hb and Mb, with O2 from Hb displacing that already bound to Mb.  

This is a means of fine-tuning oxygen delivery. During periods of low activity, myoglobin remains saturated and the equilibrium shifts toward O2 remaining bound to Hb.  When oxygen concentrations fall, oxygen rapidly exchanges from Hb to Mb, with an intrinsic lag in delivery to tissues.   This ensures that O2 delivery mimics overall saturation dynamics of Mb.  If the pool of Mb is relatively unsaturated, O2 will preferentially bind to Mb.  Only when Mb saturation reaches a threshold will O2 dissociate and diffuse in to local tissue.  

The advantages of this delivery method‚Äîas opposed to simple diffusion of O2 to tissues‚Äîare obvious.  First, O2 delivery can be maintained at a steady rate independent of transient, sharp drops in O2 concentration.  As Mb saturation levels drop, O2 delivery to tissues will decrease.  As saturation levels increase, O2 delivery will increase in step with its arrival from RBCs.  This has the effect of minimizing volatile increases in oxygen consumption, as well as modulating respiratory activity in coordination with relative oxygen delivery.  

From a chemical perspective, the existence of this saltatory O2 circuit seems intuitive and uncontestable.  If a molecule is in the solution, it will bind its ligand in the absence of any negative regulation.  Mb in an unsaturated state, being a single-subunit, noncooperative protein, will invariably take up any O2 that freely diffuses in the vicinity.  The extremely high concentrations of Mb in skeletal and cardiomyocytes makes this inevitable.

Secondly, Mb can rapidly bind O2 as it enters myocytes, thereby sequestering it and preventing downstream oxidative damage due to free cellular oxygen.  In the absence of such a mechanism the risk of oxidative damage would render myocytes exceedingly susceptible to mutation through free radical cleavage of DNA.  If this is the case, then intracellular depletion of Mb in myocytes should increase background mutation rates.",Do these comments on hemoglobin/myoglobin and oxygen delivery sound reasonable?
Biochemistry,"I made some glycerol stocks to store in the -80 freezer and there was a problem with the consistency of the solution after freezing, it was not solidified at all, it had a  slushie like consistency.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

First, a quick summary of my protocol:

\-overnight culture of ecoli XL1Blue in LB amp, 37C, 250rpm

\-after incubation (16.5 hours) took 500uL of the media and added it to 50% v/v glycerol (glycerol diluted w/ dH2O) for final glycerol concentration of 25% v/v

\-glycerol dilution, before adding media, was mixed by pipetting until homogeneous

\-after adding o/n culture to the 50% glycerol and mixing again, placed tubes in the -80 freezer

\-I did not flash freeze first with liquid nitrogen, I placed my tubes directly in the -80

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

9.5 hours later I accessed the glycerol stock to scrape some cells out with a pipette tip, to make a new overnight culture. When I did this, the glycerol stock was not at all solidified. I could have stuck the pipette tip through to the bottom of the tube with no resistance if I wanted. As I remember from working with glycerol stocks made by others, the stock should be fairly solidified.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

So my questions to you:

\-So what is my problem? Is it just that a 25% glycerol soln. takes longer to solidify than \~9 hours? If so, how long?

&amp;#x200B;

\-Did I measure something wrong? Protocols I found say 25% glycerol final conc. but do not specify v/v or w/w; I assumed v/v. 

&amp;#x200B;

\-Should I flash freeze in liquid nitrogen? What are the pros/cons to this?

Biochemistry,"Hi there, I'm trying to decide among bio and chem. Yes, I know the degree name is usually irrelevant when choosing a masters, or applying for jobs. My interests lie mostly in molecular biology/chemical biology (specifically genetics, protein structure &amp; cell biochemistry). I live in Argentina, so the educational system is pretty different from Europe's or North America's. Here, bachelors take around 4-5 years. Now, a degree in biochemistry would be ideal, because it combines both my passion for biology, and my love for chemistry. However, the only private University here that offers the degree... it's not quite well-known, and I'm not too sure if it's good enough. Public schools here are awful, mostly because they're filled with politics related protests, professors go on strike every other week, and the technology/infrastructure are insufficient. So, I'm considering private ones. Since I'm not too sure about the quality of the one that offers the Biochem degree, there's another one that offers a Chemistry degree, and a Biology degree. While my main field of interest is indeed biology, I really don't care about ecology, botany, anatomy &amp; physiology, environmental sciences or earth sciences (all of these are courses offered in the Biology degree), but rather just molecular biology. I think the pro of getting a BSc in Chem, is that it's a lot more related to problem solving, and applying knowledge to specific situations, which will help me build a stronger critical thinking. Plus, the Chem degree offers Biology fundamentals, Chemical Biology, and Molecular Biology courses as well, so it's pretty similar to Biochem, just a little bit more math/chemistry heavy. 
I plan on doing a Masters anyways, most likely either in Bioinformatics or Chemical Biology.

What I got from it is this: COX enzymes are made up of two monomers. The aminoacid sequence in both monomers is the same (homodimers) but they are functionally (?) different; one catalyses the conversion of arachidonic acid to PGG2 while the other one serves as an allosteric subunit.

Here was my original title: **If glucose-6-phosphatase both phosphorylates glucose to trap it in the cell, and dephosphorylates it to release it into the blood stream(in liver) then how does glucose get trapped in muscle?** 

&amp;#x200B;

Original post:

&amp;#x200B;

Hey everyone,

I'm studying biochemistry online and am on the topic of glycogen synthesis and glycogenolysis. I understand that the real difference between muscle glycogen and liver glycogen is in how it is utilized. Glycogen phosphorylase cleaves glucose residues from glycogen to form glucose-1-phosphate which is isomerized to glucose-6-phosphate by the same enzyme that isomerized the reverse process in glycogen synthesis. Here is where I get confused. Liver glycogen gets released by being dephosphorylated by glucose-6-phosphatase, but I'm rereading and see how muscle doesn't have glucose-6-phosphatase??? How does glucose get trapped into the muscle cells if it doesn't have this enzyme?

&amp;#x200B;

Just remembered hexokinase exists and the difference between phosphatases and kinases. Feel dumb, but posting anyway to show my frustration at learning the countless different phosphatase and kinase enzymes, with many but not all performing reversible reactions and with way too many having their very own specific phosphatase and/or kinase enzymes.

I'm trying to understand microbial metabolism a bit better. I believe bacteria can use acetate as a sould carbon source. Acetate is the result of glycolosis, of which the end product (pyruvate) is converted to Acetyl-CoA, which then enters the Citric Acid Cylce to make ATP.

Do you guys think that just the average interaction energies are a good way to give more detail to the description of the coordination sites, or should I estimate free energies? (or something else?)

Biochemistry,"Hey guys I am a senior chemistry and biology major (2 degrees) that is graduating soon. I have experience in analytical chemistry (mass spectrometery) from a few internships and am currently researching in a government lab part time where I should be co authoring on a paper soon. On the side I am also doing some bioinformatics research in metagenomics.

Ever since I got into science I always imagined my end goal being an industry job like pharma or biotech and getting a PhD would be a necessary step to get there. I have heard that a PhD is not what I should be looking to pursue if I just want a good job. Thoughts on that?

I thought I wanted to do a biochemistry PhD because I could get a job in pharma or biotech, but I have also been told that there are a lot of PhDs currently unsuccessfully searching for jobs and that moreover PhDs are not even well prepared for industry at all.

My PhD requires quite a lot of biochem techniques and unfortunately my undergrad wasn't in biochem, so I'm trudging along. I have found myself looking for an optimal solution to a problem:

I need to separate purify IgG and the main contaminant is BSA (say 500 ug of each, concentration &lt;2 mg/ml of each). 

So far I've worked through some Sephadex Resins. Fingers were crossed for a PD-10 column to work but expectedly it does not. Have emptied some PD-10 columns and refilled with Sephadex G100 and G200 resins, which failed to separate the proteins. I know that G100 and G200 should work though...Have increased column length 3-fold (Sephadex G 200) starting from PD-10 dimensions and this has not worked (although I used 10mg BSA and 2 mg IgG for this last test- next test will be to use less protein and re-evaluate because maybe peak breadth was the issue here).

I want to minimally stress the IgG (so no protein G unless all else fails). I'd like to stay away from HPLC because of reasons pertaining to additives in the mixture I should not disclose. 

I've read up on anti-BSA beads coated with a BSA specific immunoglobin but they aren't cheap, but I will use if optimization is too timely (time=money after all!)

Not keen on using isoelectric point or hydrophobicity unless people have found great success with these, because the proteins I'm working with will be modified in the future and I'm not sure how this will affect those properties (would like to avoid re-optimizations).

I'm trying to decide if I should transfer to UCLA or UC Davis/UCSC. Would it be worth it go to a less competitive school like Davis or Santa Cruz, meaning I'd be able to keep a high GPA, or would it be more valuable to go to a school like UCLA that has a more recognizable name and, I would believe, more opportunities?

Going into college was exciting and fun, I'd never really been away from my parents or even in another city without them because they were so protective, so I spent the first semester of school messing around and didn't do great but didn't do bad enough to fail out of school. Every year since then has felt like an uphill battle due to deaths in the family( I live 2 hours from my parents and drove back for these), my parents divorcing my sophomore year made that entire year very difficult, and depression and anxiety that I've apparently had for a long time but wasn't diagnosed until 2 years ago when it had finally gotten so bad that I couldn't leave my bed most of the time, work, and also just some of my own dumb ass mistakes. I've been doing college completely on my own, I'm 1st Gen and my parents have no idea how to help me with anything college related so they don't really understand the workload or how much work you have to do outside of class or why I never have any free time. So here I am, almost 6 years in and still haven't graduated, which has made me feel like a total POS. I only need 6 more classes to finish and if I take 5 summer classes and class in the fall, and pass them all, I can graduate in December.

The problem is that I'm starting to burn out. I've taken summer classes the past 3 summer, one of which being research that took up a lot of the break and part of the school year and drained me pretty bad, but I've either failed or not gotten a high enough grade ( req C and I got a C-) and have had to re-take the same classes 2 times already, which is what originally put me behind. I'm starting to feel hopeless and being in school now just makes me sad, I get up almost every morning crying because I don't want to go to class anymore. I used to be so in love with science and school and there have been multiple factors as to why that has died but now I don't even know how I feel about continuing or trying to pursue a job in the field. Being in this major and comparing myself to the rest of the class has made me feel inferior, like I don't belong there, I'm dumb, and incompetent. Which is what's killing my motivation and making my depression worse.


I guess I just need advice on the best way to go about this. 5 summer classes is a lot and they're all very math heavy, I don't want to fail again but I also don't want to be in school for another year racking up more debt.

Is it worth going to UCSC for this scholarship over other schools such as UC Davis, UCSB, UCLA, UCSD, etc...? I know that UCSC has a good biochem program, but the school its self does not have a stellar reputation when compared to most of the other UCs, at least when it comes to their undergraduate program.

Biochemistry,"Question: mixing 5mL of 0.20M of NaOH to 100mL of 0.050M of Lactic acid (pka=3.86). pH=?

Solution:
Moles of NaOH= 0.2x0.005=1x10^-3
*So moles of OH-=1x10^-3 (bc complete ionization)

Moles of Lactic acid= 0.1x0.05=0.005

ka of Lactic acid= 10^-3.86 (using pka)

Ka=[H+]^2/[HA]
10^-3.86=[H+]^2/0.05
[H+]=2.63x10^-3

*Moles of H+= (2.63x10^-3)x 0.1 (conc x vol)
=2.63x10^-4

Surplus OH-= 1x10^-3 - 2.63x10^-4
=7.37x10^-4

I hate the fact we learn to treat symptoms and not causes, that we don't dig into what may be causing the issues. The MECHANISM behind it. I know that, from a professional stand point, it's not their fault. They can't give out treatments based on theories or presumptions. They need to follow the international guidelines.

So I want to learn.

I was introduced to a guy named Matt Blackburn. He's just someone online (Divine Supercondutor TV), but he follows the principles of a guy named Ray Peat. This guy has a PhD in Biology, for those who care about credentials. I haven't looked fully into Ray Peat yet, so I'm not sure if his approach is similar, but I really like the way Matt can covey his point. He uses basic physiology to explain why certain things are good and others are bad.

But I don't want to follow a guru, seen to many people fail because of this. I want to learn straight from the source and be able to make my own conclusions. People that take a mechanistic approach and develop their own theories fascinate me, and I want to be able to do so as well.
 
I can't understand most of the things he says because I lack the basic knowledge to do so. But where do I start? Is it in biochemistry? Or perhaps physiology?

I was at a meeting the other day with a clinic, and was told that due to changes in analytical methods that they used to determine the concentration of a drug in blood tests, they had their guidelines adjusted from 0.3-0.4 nmol/l to 0.24-0.32 nmol/l.   


I quit uni before I had my course in analytical chemistry, so I'm a bit unsure, but am I the only one that thinks this sounds like bullshit? I know that different analytical methods can give different yields, but I'd logically assume that labs use some kind of extrapolation tool for different methods. If not it wouldn't make much sense to have blood test results from different labs, and not being able to compare them because they used different analytical methods to compare them.

I am  biochem major in my Junior year first semester. In our university the advisor who helps you pick classes is the head of your department. So last week I met with my advisor who is the head of the chemistry department to register for Fall 2019 (we don't have a biochem department :( ...... )He asked me what I want to do as a career, I said research, and right away he offered me to start on a research,""you can start in the Fall"" for this project they had started. I am hesitant to start on a research project because I have heard, especially in our chem department, research takes a lot of time from my schedule. And I also don't think I am ready enough for whole research project even though I will be interning this coming summer at a laboratory. I am taking five classes, I work on campus, and I would like to do research later on when I am taking less classes. I've heard there is an option to shadow a research to get a sense of the project. I definitely don't want to decline the offer, and I want to get into research in my school asap, but I also want to make sure I can commit to it. I am thinking about how I should approach him and ask him to shadow the research, I am going to meet him in person but I want to do it as professionally as possible. Also, since I am only shadowing should I bring my resume, and mention my summer internship that is coming up. He is also very casual and chill but I also want to be professional when asking for shadowing.There is  BIG BUT Though I am afraid I am going to run out of time, and not get into research in my school.

Biochemistry,"I understand that it causes low blood sugar due to ATP depletion in hepatic cells and thus less ATP for gluconeogenesis, since there is less DHAP available for glycolysis, and glyceraldehyde can only contribute to glycolysis if phosphorylated with triose kinase, which is not highly expressed in the liver (anything else I'm missing here?)

But as for lactic acidosis, I am quite confused. I don't see how a build up of Fructose-1-Phosphate can result in excess lactic acid being formed. So there is a deficiency in Aldolase B, meaning you can't cleave the F-1-P into DHAP and glyceraldehyde. You're stuck with F-1-P, which I would assume just gets transported into urine but F-1-P can't leave cells unless dephosphorylated, and I am not sure if there is a phosphatase available for that reaction.

The second one is supposed to be using E-cadherin stain. I guess it doesn't look *awful*, but skov-3 is meant to be mesenchymal anyway, and not really express much E-cad so it confuses me.

People in my family generally start drinking coffee earlier than usual, with me starting around 8 and my mom around the same age. To me this is normal, but other people have been really surprised by this so I'm not really sure how uncommon it is. Around 17-18 I took up vaping with my friends and we vaped a lot, with fairly high doses of nicotine. My very first juice was 12mg which usually is harsh even for smokers, and my friend got a juul and then something else similar to a juul which I would use when I was hanging with him. I was like that with brief periods of quitting with my friend for about 2 years probably and eventually through certain events needed to quit completely, which ended up not being a problem for me and I'm still quit to this day. For my friends though it was a completely story and they had major withdrawals and a very long and arduous quitting process that ended up not being successful for either of them.

I always chalked this up to our genes, and that I must have just lucked out and not gotten whatever genes make you more easily addicted to nicotine, but I'm constantly hearing all kinds of people compare nicotine and caffeine and likening their effects on the body. I remember by the time I was 13 (maybe earlier I'm really bad at remembering how old I was in my memories) coffee pretty much didn't effect me in any noticable way anymore, and I think most of it's effect on me is just placebo now, with the routine waking my mind up more than the caffeine is waking my body up. Is it possible that through all my time of drinking coffee and my body getting used to it and adapting to it, it taught my body how to do the same with nicotine in a similar way to how vaccines work? This probably isn't at all how it works and in very much not a biochemist, but I was curious if anyone knowledgeable on the scientific workings of things like caffeine and nicotine had any input on this.

TL;DR: I spent my entire childhood drinking coffee and for a long time now it hasn't had any noticable effect on me, is this related to how easily I was able to quit nicotine after almost 2 years of vaping?",Can an entire childhood of consuming caffeine and becoming building a resistance to it reduce the effects of nicotine addiction?

This text from my textbook keeps me confused about the relationship of the equilibrium constant, gibbs free energy, and Michaelis-Menten equation.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

"" If Œî*G*0 is a negative number, *K*eq will be greater than unity, and the concentration of products at equilibrium will exceed that of the substrates. If Œî*G*0 is positive, *K*eq will be less than unity, and the formation of substrates will be favored. ""

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

In particular the phrasing of ""unity"" has me confused. I understand that Keq is equal to concentration of products over concentration of reactants. I understand if the products are at a lower energy state, thus having a negative change in total free energy, the reaction will favor the products. The opposite favoring the substrates/reactants. I just don't understand what Keq is being compared to here.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

How does Keq relate to the rate of the equation? I thought it was just a descriptor of when the reaction was moving forward and backward at the same rate. I know it's staring me in the face but I am really hung up on this topic and would appreciate another explanation besides my textbook.

1. What is the difference between tertiary structure of a protein and a protomer? 


I thought they were the same. I understand primary structure is the aa chain. I understand that secondary structure is the interactions of residues in the chain via hydrogen bonds, the major types being alpha helices, beta sheets, and loops/turns/bends. As for tertiary structure, I understand some but not all so this is where confusion ramps up. I can wrap my mind around it being made up of secondary structure units which will interact with each other via hydrogen bonds, steric hindrance, polarity, and Van der Waals forces. I understand that quaternary structure is made up of tertiary structures that interact with the same forces that make up tertiary structures, just on the next larger scale. Where I get confused is when talking about quaternary structures most any resource refers to the subunits as either protomers or just polypeptide subunits.  Then there is how various resources mix and match terms, refering to primary structure as a ""polypeptide"", then use it to describe tertiary structure sometimes with ""mature polypeptide"" instead, then later they'll refer to protomers as polypeptides. Polypeptide = chain of aa boned through peptide bonds, so I guess using it on any level would be right but it just confuses me. 


2. Domains?


That kinda is it. Are they single points of secondary structure inside a Tertiary structure? Or are they only in quaternary structure? I understand that they are points of functionality that can be interacted with, but I don't understand why or how i need to think of them moving forward.

Biochemistry,"So in my cell biology class we are doing this lab, and the lab handout I feel doesn‚Äôt explain what is going on very well. I tried googling it, I found a similar lab online but it still didn‚Äôt answer my questions.

Basically, we take some epithelial cheek cells, and to one slide we add con A buffer, to another con A buffer and Con-A peroxidase (so it stains the con A receptors purple) and to the 3rd slide we add con a peroxidase and galactose, and to the fourth we added con a peroxidase and mannose. The goal is to find whether con a receptors bind with which sugar. The con a peroxidase should make a purple color change when it binds to the receptors.

The first slide would show no binding
The second slide would show con A peroxidase binding ? (Or am I wrong)

The third slide showed the most purple, I am thinking no binding of galactose since con a peroxidase would bind instead of the sugar

And the fourth slide showed little purple more like the first slide so I believe mannose is binding instead of the peroxidase?

I am mostly confused on if I have this understanding right because wouldn‚Äôt con A peroxidase be more of an enzyme not the thing that binds, but then what reaction would it be speeding up? 

Also what is the purpose of the con A buffer we added? (It has NaCl, MnSo4, and CaCl2 , bovine serum albumin and TrisHCl but all very diluted) does the buffer just maintain a constant ph for these reactions?

Biochemistry,"Hey everybody! I thought this would be a good sub to ask the question: what is the best way to get hired in the biochemistry/life-science/pharma field?

For context, I graduated in May 2018 with a BS in biochemistry and a BS in environmental science. I worked (for free) as an undergraduate research technician for a little over a year in a microbiology lab, working by myself on a research project for the PI. I was able to get decent experience in GC, HPLC, UV-VIS and other ""desired"" skills through this experience. 

Upon graduation, I had not had any luck with finding a job in my field, and instead accepted an offer to manage a brand new aquatics facility as the aquatics director. I trained and supervised a staff of 30 people for the entire summer season, with my position ending mid-September, 2018. I write about this experience in most of my cover letters.

I started applying to jobs in the field around late-August as my aquatics director position was ending. I coasted off of my (small) savings in October, and in November I took a part time job as a server/bartender to help pay the bills. 

To this day I have still not been able to land so much as an interview for any positions in the field. I've been mostly applying to ""technician"" positions which are listed as entry level, but still want ""3 years experience in the position."" 

I have been looking for jobs on Indeed, LinkedIn, Craigslist, Reddit, and other random job sites, and I write a custom cover letter and resume for each application. To date, I have not included my restaurant experience in my applications, but I'm worried that the gap in my resume is starting to hurt me.

To complicate things, I am searching for positions which are in different markets from where I currently live. I know most employers give preference to local candidates, but I just don't have the funds to move right now without knowing I would have a stable job in the new city.

My question basically boils down to: how can I better stand out in a stack of resumes, or how can I network in a different State (USA) without being there? Is there a better way to find and apply for jobs in the field (recruiters, cold calling, etc)?

Although we have both been able to manage living apart without it causing too much stress, we are eager to be able to live together and continue building our life. I am planning to move in with her next year after I graduate. For (boring) reasons we'll probably end up moving again in two years. We don't yet know where we'll end up landing.

Based on my career goals (basic research, probably in acedemia but the right position in industry or government would be fine also) it seems like a postdoc is the next step for me after I graduate, but I am worried that I wouldn't be able to do a productive postdoc in just one year.

Biochemistry,"I was wondering if I could get some clarification on endothelial transport and frustrated with the resources available on Pubmed. I have similar questions for most of the hydrophobic bio molecules. If they require a transport protein that makes them hydrophilic enough to circulate, then they will require a endothelial receptor.

Or am I missing that when a receptor for a specific cell is described, they are really saying it is expressed on the endothelial cells that supply that tissue? For example, Lipoprotein Lipase is commonly described to be expressed by adipocytes, when it is really expressed by the endothelial cells that supply the adipocytes.

One specific example is Vitamin A and RBP which is described as Holo-RBP and its membrane receptor STRA6. I'm unsure of how RBP initially gets into the interstitial through the endothelium.

Or is STRA6 more accurately described as an endothelial receptor that supplies the parenchymal cells and Vitamin A is released directly to the endothelium?

There is a FTIR Perkin Elmer Frontier spectra and energy dispersive spectroscopy (below) of an white powder like contamination on an aluminum surface. At first, we thought that it was an oxidation. It looked like oxidation on machined surfaces. We even had several theories about its root cause. However, it was not the case.

Let me tell you about the process that this aluminum part goes through. This cast aluminum part is sanded before machining. It gets machined and has contact with boron oil. After the machining process the part is washed (with sodium silicate), rinsed and dried. The water that is used in the machining and the washing process is ionized with zero hardness level (measured weekly. We began to measure conductivity leves recently).  The part cools down then goes to assembly for few components. After the assembly and the final check it gets packaged in a case. Each case has multiple parts. Cases are sealed with sack-like plastic cover, have zips, and there are separating plastic sheets. These cases wait up to couple of days for transport. Then they head to their destination which takes ten days. Recently we had problems with these parts. There is a white powder like substance on some of its surfaces. We haven't had that kind of a problem during summer or fall. We do suspect that it could be due to weather conditions. But, we're not sure whether it's because the cases are sealed too well that humidity does not escape, or they are not sealed well and something happens on the transportation. We also focused on what could cause because of the washing process, went through several things, but still not 100% sure of the root cause. The interesting thing is just recently similar thing has been reported from the same location. It was worse than before. They describe it as oxidation looking, wax like substance this time. Not quite sure whether it is caused by something different or it is due to same thing, but advanced/grown.

So I‚Äôm an undergrad researcher working on nucleotide synthesis and just finished purifying a deamination reaction of adenosine to inosine. We use sodium nitrite to facilitate the reaction and I accidentally mixed a fraction of 50/50 sodium/inosine into the mix after running a column, which is now resulting in a lovely 150% yield. It‚Äôs not the end if the world, but I desperately do not want to have to run the column again because I‚Äôve reason to believe there‚Äôs a good amount of pure inosine (the TLCs were gorgine) and I‚Äôm scared of losing any significant yield (I also just don‚Äôt want to spend 3 hours repeating a column I already finished...).

My thought process is to use an organic solvent to extract the inosine so that the salt won‚Äôt solubilize and then just vacuum filter the reaction, but following the deamination our product is virtually organic insoluble/heavily favors water.

Biochemistry,"Hey all, so I understand this isn't the kind of question normally asked on this subreddit, and that I'm asking this question in a heavily biased environment but I figured it would be best to do so in a forum full of people with experience on the subject. In short, I'm unsure as to whether or not choosing to go on and study Biochemistry at degree level (I'll hopefully be starting university this September, so have already made all of my choices to study Biochemistry) was the right choice to make, and essentially I'd just appreciate advice on how to prepare for the future.

So to begin, I must stress that I absolutely LOVE Biochemistry - I am absolutely captivated by the concept of breaking down complex biological systems into their most fundamental steps, to allow us to better understand how they interact with one another to produce an end result. I myself know, in my heart of hearts, that I would love to study Biochemistry to learn more about such systems as respiration and (in particular) genetics, as I am absolutely enthralled whenever I have the chance to learn more about them.

My main cause for doubt/concern at the moment is the fact that, having asked multiple of my school teachers and consulted more web sources than I dare to count, not one of them has actually advocated towards studying Biochem, instead almost trying to steer anyone with an interest clear of even considering it an option. One of the key issues that I have, in my mind, is that I go to a school with a very narrow-minded outlook on science - to many, it seems, if you are not either a doctor or an engineer, you have no right to call yourself a scientist at all, and that's the thing that's worrying me the most. With artificial intelligence and robotics becoming noticeably more and more prevalent with every passing year, I worry that studying a subject that I truly love will also mean studying one that will ultimately lead to very little, to the point of being arbitrary (at least in the eyes of a world that appears to only have its heart set on Physics and Computing being the only 'real sciences.') Because of this, I almost feel guilty for even wanting to study Biochem in the first place, and I haven't been able to rest easy for the last year because of this, since what with literally every other source I've seen singing the praises of subjects like Engineering and Computing whilst not giving Biochemistry even a passing mention except to warn of the dangers of studying it, I can't help but constantly feel like I've made the wrong choice.

Forgive me if I sound overly paranoid - I feel as though I need to stop speculating and actually get a reality check those who have knowledge, experience and a passion for Biochem, hence why I'm here. Again, I understand that this isn't normally the sort of question that gets asked on this subreddit (at least from what little I've seen) but regardless I appreciate your time and any replies this might receive.

Because to me, it can go both ways:

Magnitude: If G^(final) = 5 and G^(initial) = 10, then delta G = 5-10 = -5 = work is done. Here the ""lower G"" is the 5 and the ""higher G"" is the 10

Biochemistry,"I'm trying to isolate ribosomes from e. coli. I am interested in studying the individual ribosomal proteins and not the rRNA. My approach was to isolate the intact ribosomes by pelleting over a sucrose cushion, as described in in the Cold Spring Harbor Protocol ([http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2015/3/pdb.prot081331](http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2015/3/pdb.prot081331)). Then, I want to remove any nucleic acids so that I am left with the individual proteins.

&amp;#x200B;

I have already followed the protocol above using about 10 g of MRE600 clarified lysate with a few exceptions. I do not have access to a french press, so I used a high-pressure emulsifier and, I do not have any DNAse. The core facility manager suggested the emulsifier as a substitute for the french press and mentioned that the act of emulsifying may shear the genomic DNA. So, the sheared DNA should stay in the lysate/sucrose and out of the pellet. Since I am not doing functional assays and intend on disassembling the ribosomes anyways, I am not too concerned with contamination of genomic DNA. 

I have since ordered DNAse but I was wondering if the pellet I had was usable. There were two ""layers"" to the pellet. One brown and less viscous layer on the top that I poured off into a 15 ml falcon tube and another gel-like layer that I had to scrape from the bottom. The latter layer is in a second 15 mL tube. I added approximately 2 volumes of resuspension buffer and rotated overnight at 4C to get everything into solution. I then tested acid-induced precipitation of the RNA followed by precipitation of the proteins with cold acetone using \~500 uL of the solubilized pellet. While I have not yet run a gel, I believe this worked - both steps resulted in precipitates. Residual acetone from the second precipitation was dried; I now have \~15 mg of powder. My questions are:

1) Is the omission of DNAse going to be detrimental to my separation?

2) Does the high-speed spin also force the membrane fraction (sheared membranes + membrane proteins) to co-pellet?

3) I am under the impression that the individual proteins can be recombined with the necessary rRNA to reassemble the subunits. While I don't intend to do this, will the acid and organic solvent not cause irreversible unfolding of the proteins?

4) Am I going all wrong about this and is there a better protocol to follow?

I am seeking ideas on how to study this phage....

I am studying 15 bacteriophages. These phages are both temporally and geographically isolated but are very similar in genetic context. For example, the variance of their GC content is about 1 percent. This is an uncommon phenomenon amongst most bacteriophages.

Yet the bacterial hosts they infect, covers a broad range of strains (about 30 different strains were studied, only three were resistant). These three resistant phages contained CRISPR elements. So really, we have 15 near identical phages that can affect a broad range of hosts.

Also someone suggested I contact random professors since some professors only do research and don‚Äôt teach. 2) So what would make a student stand out if the professor never had the student in a class. 3) Is two research internships enough? 4) also, internships and school research helps build your resume, but what if most of them don‚Äôt exactly relate to your major? which is kind of hard to get internships on biochemistry as a student
Any advice would be appreciated! Thanks!

Biochemistry,"So in my lectures we learned about muscle contraction like this:  (short version)
Ca++ is released, binds to troponin on actin filaments, exposing the binding site for myosin. Myosin then binds to actin, using ATP which phosphorylates to contract and relax.
I am currently reading a book about pharmacology in which it is described differently:
Ca++ binds to Calmodulin, which activates MLCK (myosin light chain kinase). MLCK phosphorylates the light chain of myosin, making it active as an ATPase and making it bind to actin. The muscle then contracts. As soon as Ca++ is not present anymore, the muscle relaxes.

Now, in the book it states that this happens in smooth muscle tissue. I've also read that smooth muscle tissue doesnt have troponin on its actin fibers. My assumption now is that the first contraction mechanism is used only in skeletal muscle tissue, while the second one is present in smooth muslce tissue.

Biochemistry,"Hello all,

I'm looking for the best approach to fluorescently stain E. coli for observation under a microscope.  Ideally this approach would stain all E. coli (independent of serotype) and no other species of bacteria (although I'm not sure how feasible this is).  I should note that the bacteria will be fixed and permeabilized at the time of staining. So far I have tried the following fluorescently labelled antibodies:

They have all given negligible staining, even at the very high suggested concentrations (1:10 dilution, this seems very high to me).  I have a feeling that these are questionable antibodies, since none of them have very good documentation of use cases.

It has been surprisingly difficult for me to find pan-e coli antibodies by Googling around.  Perhaps this is because there isn't a good surface marker that is shared across e. coli strains but not other species?

I have started to investigate the idea of using phages, although I don't have a good understanding of how these compare to antibodies and the relative merits of each.

If anyone has a good idea of what approach will give me strong, reproducible staining I would very much appreciate it!

Biochemistry,"Hi Guys

I have read many reports, that taking around 1.2 g of NAC after drinking alcohol reduces the hang over. Its supposed to work by replenishing the cystein storage in the body, because in the degradiation process of acetaldehyde glutathione is needed. Therefore it is possible (since the amount of cystein in the body are quite small) to build more glutathione and the degradiation of acetaldehyde is therefore faster. Because acetaldehyde is actually much more harmful than ethanol, the amount of liver and organ damage is reduced. Now to my question: Is it even possible, that the degradiation of alcohol is also faster (eventhough its one of the exeples for linear enzyme kinetics) due to a shift in the equilibrium between acetaldehyde? Since the amount of acetaldehyde is reduced this would make sense to me, eventhough the quantity of ethanol would still be in excess... ",N-Acetylcystein and alcohol degradation

Biochemistry,"Thank you for reading this. 
My question is based on human fatty acid metabolism (but mostly on the catabolism or 'burning' part). 
When the body is 'burning fat' i've heard that [this is through beta-oxidation](https://www.physiology.org/doi/full/10.1152/physrev.00015.2009). When nutrition researchers discuss ketogenic diets (or starvation), they focus on [ketone metabolism, pretty much ignoring beta oxidation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_QpkuF6k43ovI66AD7M0eXMAyKMP_SIV/view?usp=sharing). Curiously, when popular websites discuss fat burning in terms of nutrition, they [equate ketosis to fat burning](https://www.webmd.com/diabetes/type-1-diabetes-guide/what-is-ketosis#1). But this leaves me confused.

.

if I understand correctly (maybe not):

* ketones are the product of acetyl-coa 'excess' in the liver that is shuttled to cells in the body and is then converted back to acetyl-coa and burned in the Krebs cycle.
* triglycerides in the cell break down to fatty acids which are in turn cleaved (via beta-oxidation) into units of acetyl-coa which is burned in the Krebs cycle. 

this seems to suggest that ketone and fatty acid oxidation are different processes that (as far as i can see here) can run parallel to each other; barring any regulatory pathways like the one that 'favors' glycolysis to lipolysis. 

so what am I missing here? 


* does the body burn fatty acids and ketones in different pathways?

* are these pathways relatively disconnected (can one or both catabolize fatty acids in their own way, limited only by energy needs) or are they competitive as i understand glucose and fat to be?

* what would 'fat burning' (from a nutritionist's perspective) look like for those two pathways? 
* and finally, do you have any good sources for more on this type of fatty acid and ketone metabolism I can focus on?

thank you so much!

(I apologize if I posted this in the wrong forum or if this question was asked before or if it's terribly ignorant. I tried to use my google fu to find it but found tons of stuff that didn't clarify the issue and most disucssions of beta oxidation ignored ketones and those that discussed ketones ignored beta oxidation for the most part. this is why i thought I'd ask. thanks again)",fatty acid metabolism: beta oxidation versus ketone utilization

Biochemistry,"Hi, I am a high school student hoping to study biochemistry in uni. One concept I still find very difficult to grasp is the idea of Gibb's free energy and spontaneous reaction. Here is what I understand.

According to second Law of Thermodynamics, entropy always increase. Reading Atkins's Atoms, Electrons and Changes, I tend to understand entropy as 1.) Dispersal of matter 2.) Delocalisation of energy. This concept aids me in understanding spontaneous reactions or physical changes such as why protein folds or why non-polar molecules can not dissolve in water.  


At the same time, I also read that Gibb's free energy is the amount of free energy available in a system to do useful work. When something goes from unstable to stable (low entropy to high entropy), useful energy is released and that can be harnessed to do work. This concept is easier to understand chemical changes (I suppose) such as how ATP can be used to release energy by losing the weak and unstable third phosphate bond. What  I am confused is 1.) Which defintion is more accurate 2.) the logical linkage between ""increasing stability/increasing entropy"" and ""energy released/ available to do useful work"".

I have a few biochemistry questions that I got from reading my book that I was hoping to get some help on. Here are a few:

&amp;#x200B;

1) My book discusses Z conformations in DNA, and says it occurs whenever there is a purine-pyrimidine-purine pattern in DNA... I can't find anything online to say this is true, and I'm surprised this is the case considering there probably a lot of purine-pyrimidine-purine patterns in everyday DNA. Can anyone clarify this?

2) My next question is based on the following image:

[https://imgur.com/a/kVYVIB9](https://imgur.com/a/kVYVIB9)

The image above shows H-DNA, or triplex DNA. A description of what is happening above includes ""If the C:T bases in half of this stretch separated from their G:A partners and the unpaired C:T segment folded back on the C:T half still paired in the C:T/G:A duplex, triplex DNA could form through Hoosteen base pairings."" My question is about the statement that says ""... the unpaired C:T segment folded back on the C:T half..."" Is this correct? In the image, isn't the unpaired C:T strand folding back on the G:A strand, not the C:T strand? Or am I being confused by what it is trying to say?  


3)  Next, the book discusses G-quadruplexes, and how d(G4T4G4) strands come together as hairpins to form G-quadruplexes. What does this mean by ""hairpin""? I am confused by this image.

&amp;#x200B;

4) The next question I have is when my book discusses renaturation of DNA. My book discusses how there are steps in the denaturation and renaturation of DNA. In one part, it states ""The nucleation phase of the reaction (the renaturation reaction) is a second-order process depending on the sequence alignment of the two strands."" What does nucleation mean here? Here is a picture of the Figure and its description:

As far as I can see, there is only one hydrogen ion from the alcohol group of the sugar, so my question is: where does the other hydrogen ion come from? If it is a free proton from the environment, wouldn't the cell become more alkaline during DNA synthesis?",Question regarding DNA synthesis

Biochemistry,"I am a 20 year old guy, and should start university next year. I have been originally planning to study computer science (I am good at programming and enjoy it), but now I'm not so sure.

I learned biology in high school and this got me slowly interested in pharmacology. I started thinking how much can be achieved with future drugs, and started reading scientific papers about the subjects I'm interested in. I did that a lot in recent years, and now I do that daily, slowly getting better at understanding methodologies and certain terms (like p-value / statistical significance, etc), though I'm sure I still barely know anything, and have a lot to learn. This has almost become an addiction at this point - I read papers in my free time instead of gaming now.

The more I read, the more I get excited about pharmacology. It's mind-blowing to think just how much pharmacology can do for us. In the future, I believe we could cure certain cancers (eventually all of them), find safer less addictive pain medications, completely reverse certain chronic diseases by promoting endogenous robust tissue regeneration (ie. Fully reverse stroke / MI damage by just regenerating the necrotic/fibrotic tissue to a normal one), allow gene editing in adults with orally delivered agents (and thus even eliminate conditions we were born with)... And maybe, just maybe, we could realize how to reverse past cellular aging and to eliminate age-related deaths.

I know this sounds grandiose, and that I actually know nothing about the complexity of drug design, being an extremely expensive and risky field, with more failures than successes. But when I think just how much future drugs can change humanity for the better... I am amazed. So amazed I can't stop obsessing over it. 

I don't know how much I can work at drug design, though. I have executive function problems (ADHD &amp; possibly Asperger's syndrome) and poor motor control, so that actually being part of a team that conducts rodent research can be a significant problem for me. I don't think I can handle doing all the lab procedures, especially not actually injecting rodents with stuff, or decapitating them and examining their tissues...

What do you guys think? Should I just shake this off, because I don't have realistic expectations?",Considering a career in drug design - are my expectations realistic?
Biochemistry,"Hello everyone,

&amp;#x200B;

I have a few biochemistry questions I hope can be answered. I am having some trouble with some concepts from my book that still confuse me after online research. Any help would be amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

1) Can someone please explain how Illumina sequencing works? The concept is pretty difficult for me, and the online resources are not much help.

&amp;#x200B;

2)  The next question I have has to deal with the following image:

It is regarding the circled part. First of all, regarding this image and its description, what does ""six degrees of freedom"" mean in this context? Also, regarding the circled part, what is this trying to show with the ""X"" and the ""epsilon""? Any clarity would be amazing. 

&amp;#x200B;

3) The next question I have is regarding the following image:

[https://imgur.com/a/EJRuoJE](https://imgur.com/a/EJRuoJE)

My question is about the circled part. Why are some dots blue and some grey? I do not understand what they are supposed to represent, since they are all carbon atoms. Also, I am confused by the subheadings that say ""syn"" and ""anti"" along with them.

4) Here is another image for a question:

Biochemistry,"After 10 months of job searching since I graduated with a BS in Biochemistry last December, I‚Äòve finally found a suitable job. A bit of background, I decided not to even try to go to grad school because my grades are so poor that it would be a waste of time and money. That being said, I performed well when it mattered. I scored A‚Äôs in my research courses and in some of the most difficult biochem courses my school had to offer.

I networked religiously, I interviewed all over, and I submitted hundreds upon hundreds of applications, and all this work got me nowhere. I had checked out, and resigned myself to working at a warehouse for $10 per hour, and attempting to get into grad school, until my ex girlfriend of all people encouraged me to continue. I submitted a handful of online applications and somehow, for only the second time in my search, one of these mindless submissions resulted in an interview.

Without giving away too many details, I now have a job working as a research assistant at a large well funded research institute. They pay a living wage, and I have benefits, meaning that I can actually afford to start paying back student loans. The PI has already told me since I started that he is open to having me as his next PhD student if I want it.

Basically, everything worked out. I know there is a lot of stress for people who have a Biochemistry degree but don‚Äôt have the means to attend grad school for one reason or another, and so they are stuck with a bachelor‚Äôs degree that doesn‚Äôt easily score you a job. But, it is possible to find a job with this degree, you just have to keep searching, and put forth your best efforts.

To those of you still searching, hold onto hope, and keep up the work. I would not have this job if I had given up, and I firmly believe that I also would not have gotten it if I had not thoroughly put in the effort to interview strongly and to follow up the interview correctly. One small tip I have for you is to create a pitch for someone as to why they should hire a person with a Biochemistry degree. Learning this will help you answer a lot of typical interview questions about you, your skillset, and your background; this will confirm to the interviewer that you are the right one for the job. 

I‚Äôd also like to add that I somehow managed this in a city without many opportunities for people with this degree. There are virtually no biotech companies here, and the only real jobs would all require at least a masters degree. 

Keep trying, you just might beat the odds.","Job success story, to motivate those of you who are still searching."

Biochemistry,"I have to separate two proteins in a bsa/cyt c mixture (no other proteins present) via ion-exchange and then prove separation. The only **hints** we have been given are that **A)** the simplest possible method would only require *1 - 1.5 hrs max* start to finish and **B)** the experiment can be done *using methods we have already performed* in this class. (Note: Apart from several chromatography protocols, the only techniques we have explored include: Bradford assays, activity assays, and SDS-PAGE.)

Prior to these hints, I was leaning towards using SDS-Page as confirmation; however, every experiment we have done using chromatography + electrophoresis has taken *at least* 2.5 hours start to finish. Therefore, I am now leaning towards spectrophotometic &amp; visual confirmation as the approach our professor is hinting upon. Unfortunately, we haven't had experience measuring proteins directly, I was hoping someone with more expertise could tell me if I am on the right path here? I will list key properties of each that I believe are important to the process and then an outline of the approach I am hoping will work. *I would be eternally grateful for any input you can offer.* 

**Cyt c properties:**

* pI= 10.37-10.85 **\***
* Absorbance= \~415nm **++** 
* MW= 12,327 **\***
* Visual = Reddish tint due to heme group **++** 

**BSA properties:**

* pI= 4.7-4.9 **\***
* Absorbance= 280nm **++** 
* MW= 66,430 **\*** 
* Visual = clear \*

**\*** Obtained from Sigma using the catalog #s we were given for the specific [cyt c](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/c3131?lang=en&amp;region=US) and [bsa](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/a2153?lang=en&amp;region=US) in the mixture.

**++** Found searching through literature; I believe these are correct, but not completely sure.

\--------------------------------------------------------------

**Outline:**

* Use Q-sepharose gel (positively charged anion exchanger) equilibrated in bicine buffer, pH 8
   * *Reasoning: pH of 8 will cause BSA to carry a negative charge while giving a positive charge to cyt c.*
* Add mixture to column and wash with bicine buffer, pH 8 until all of the red is eluted from column. Collect wash elution in 2 mL fractions.
   * *Reasoning:* BSA (-) will adhere to column (+), while positively charged cyt c will elute with wash.
* Elute BSA with 1M NaCl  and collect into 2 mL fractions
   * *Reasoning: Previous IEX experiment which was similar to this use an NaCl gradient to elute a protein by adding increasing concentrations of NaCl to the column. Our protein was fully eluted around 0.6 M NaCl, so using just eluting all at once with 1M NaCl should work, right? Or is it necessary to use a gradient?*
* Confirm separation visually via the color difference between wash fractions (cyt c) and elution fractions (BSA)
   * *Reasoning: Reddish tint in wash, but not in elution will prove that cytochrome c has been separated from the mixture; however, it says nothing about whether BSA was successfully eluted/separated (proven in next step)*
* Add Bradford reagent to elution fractions to confirm that BSA elution 
   * *Reasoning: Bradford reagent will detect the presence of protein. Thus, if the fractions turn blue, the protein detected must be BSA by elimination since the mixture was comprised of only BSA and cyt c (which was shown to be separated in previous step*
* Confirm separation of cyt c spectrophotometrically by directly measuring each wash fraction at 415nm until a peak is defined (done graphically by plotting the absorbance of each fraction). 
* Confirm separation of bsa spectrophotometrically - **This is where I am most confused: I believe I have 2 options, but I don¬¥t know which route is best.**
   * Use Bradford assay and measure each elution fraction at 595nm until peak is defined graphically **OR**
   * Measure fractions directly (without Bradford reagent) at 280nm with a UV spec until peak is defined
      * Important consideration: we also only have one UV spec available to the whole class, so using the standard specs would be preferable if this is an option.

Really sorry for the long post, but I wanted to be thorough and state why I think this should work in case there were any flaws in my reasoning. In your opinion, does this approach make sense? If not, is there an easier method that I am overlooking?

I was recently reading through my Biochemistry book, and I am hoping to get some help on some concepts I am struggling with. Here are some of my questions:

1.  What is the difference between a deoxynucleoside and a deoxynucleotide? Online resources simply seem to be confusing me more. 

2.  My next question is based on the following link: [https://imgur.com/a/JjvJrbQ](https://imgur.com/a/JjvJrbQ)

In the equation where the dNMPs are adding on more dNMPs from dNTPs, I understand where the product of pyrophosphate comes from, but I don't really understand where the loss of simply ""H+"" comes from? In a video I saw online, water goes away, but not simply ""H+"". Can someone please help explain this?

3. The next question I have is on the ratio of ddNTPs and dNTPs in the Sanger method of sequencing. Doesn't this ratio matter? My book is unclear on to what this ratio is, and simply says that there are a lot more dNTPs than ddNTPs. My question with that is wouldn't too little cause some sites to be unspecified and too much cause the strands that are longer to be never synthesized? Any clarity on this would be fantastic. 

4. My next question is about the following figure:

[https://imgur.com/a/zht151m](https://imgur.com/a/zht151m)

I have a question about the underlined part to the right (under the ""Figure 11.4"" heading). Why is it called ""primed"" synthesis?

Biochemistry,"Hello all. I am currently in an mid-degree crisis. Im in my third year at university, and doing really well in all my classes which include organic chemistry, genetics, and physics. However, I'm slowly realizing that the passion I once had for this topic is slowly dying, in part due to the fact that I abhor lab work. I don't know if it's my professors, or the extremely stressed environment, or even the shame you feel when you mess up a 4 week experiment and have to start over---- I despise it. I realize this is a BIG part of this field, and I'm scared in admitting that I hate it.Add to that the mess that is hybrid classes, and you have yourself a stressful semester with poor quality of life that makes you wonder why you are dong this to yourself in the first place. I have a deep passion for history and philosophy, but never jumped the gun for fear that it was a useless major. Now im wondering if I made the wrong decision. Part of me wants to keep pushing through this year and the next, and then get into a masters program to become a genetic counselor, but another part of me REALLY wants to be a historian studying ancient documents and interpreting them or even being a contributing member to a historical society (specifically for the middle ages). I feel trapped, to say the least, with no drive to continue my classes. I'm not sure what I should do. I'm afraid to admit that my passion lies somewhere else, but I'm also afraid to end up an economic mess. What do you guys think? I have pretty much no out of class lab experience, no internship experience, and my relationships with my teachers are pretty dismal partly because I find them all to be pretty condescending  people. I love the THEORY behind genetics and all that, but the LAB potion and lab reports are what I hate the most. I wouldn't mind researching for history, however...it's what I do for fun! Reading massive history textbooks is one of my favorite passtimes, and the reason why I am wondering if i shouldve just went with that as a major. If you made it this far...thank you. I'm sure not many people wil read this giant wall of text, but I'm in the library right now trying to study for a genetics test all the while trying to shush the voice in my head telling me I made the wrong choice. Either way, any advice would be welcome. Thank you",Biochem Major having crisis.

Activating the reduced cytochrome detoxification may be an important point in FQAD patients.

Biochemistry,"Hello all.  This has been a burning question on my mind that I have never gotten a sufficient answer for.  

When consuming animal proteins, from meat specifically, that had been loaded with glycogen from a diet high in carbohydrate, would you be able to digest and directly use the glucose trapped as glycogen in said meat?  

I understand that after a period of time the glycogen would just be converted into lactic acid due to glycolysis that continues in the muscle cell after death, but, if consumed recently enough post death when glycogen is still present, would we be able to free the glycogen from the muscle cells in our digestive tract as glucose without glycogen phosphorylase, debranching enzyme, or glucose-6-phosphatase? 

It would seem that the answer would be no and that it would just pass through our GI tract assuming that 1) those enzymes are not present in the digestive tract and 2) those enzymes are necessary to liberate consumed muscle glycogen in the digestive tract.

Biochemistry,"I'm in my final year doing a research project for 15 credits. I've been in the lab a couple of weeks, and part of my project was to amplify a gene called Smaug2. This has been attempted by various students for 2 years and not seen any results. I've tried about 10+ PCR attempts now, and hadn't seen any evidence of amplification on my agarose gels apart from ridiculously faint banding on one or two gels- it's practically invisible, I had to confirm with a few people that I wasn't making it up and ran multiple gels to confirm it wasn't some weird artefact of the gel.

Anyway, no matter what conditions of PCR I tried (changing denaturation time, annealing temp &amp; time, extension time, different buffers, different polymerases, difference cDNAs, different concentrations of DMSO and Magnesium) nothing seemed to work at all.

Until Friday, I decided to run the most promising previous attempts on a gel at a higher concentration than I'd been loading them at (10 microlitres, plus 2 microlitres of 6x loading dye, as opposed to 5 and 1, or 5 and 2 with 5 microlitres of water), and I got really dramatic results compared to the blank gels I had been seeing.

https://imgur.com/a/HWUJv1W

The album here explains my attempts and situation, and shows pictures of the gels before Friday and after I realised that loading at a higher concentration gave me much more banding.

My supervisor seems fairly unconvinced and uninterested in the banding I'm seeing, so I was wondering what people here think- could the PCR products have been missed or below the LOD for imagery, could I now be seeing something other than amplification on the gels, why/what could be happening?

* How much maths is involved in biochemistry? I'm really bad at maths so I'm worried that I'll have trouble later on in the course if I take higher biochem courses.

* What kind of chemistry is involved in biochemistry? E.g., thermodynamics or acid/base equilibria. kinetics? bonding? Analytical chemistry or more o-chem style of chemistry? (I found organic easier because it requires tons of memorisation which makes more sense to me).

* What do you guys do in the lab? What kind of research does biochem typically entail?

Biochemistry,"Hello friends,

To the best of my knowledge, freebases of substances are the most easily absorbed when vaporized or smoked (hence the synonym for vaporizing, ""freebasing"") and inhaled. Pax labs created a proprietary vaporizing nicotine delivery system which has both patented hardware and nicotine liquid, and is very highly potent in terms of nicotine ""buzz."" The common conception in the vaping community, which is somewhat supported by pax labs statements regarding their product, the ""juul,"" is that the reason this product is so potent is that it uses a salt form of nicotine rather than a freebase form, which has been the standard in vaping.

What I know about chemistry tells me that this is a mistaken belief, drawn from misinterpretation of the pax labs statements regarding the formulation of juul liquid, and that freebase nicotine is absorbed much more readily from vaporization than salt nicotine. It is my understanding that the liquid pax uses is carefully formulated to have optimal pH for nicotine absorption, and that the nicotine they use is not the same as the pure salt nicotine base formulation which is available on the private market, but rather a simplification of a more complicated chemical properties of the liquid's contents which allow some sort of conversion between salt and freebase form (similar to Philip morris' use of pH manipulation in cigarettes).

I am wondering if anyone here can provide any scientific research which would support my belief that A) in general, freebases are more readily absorbed than salts when vaporized, and B) (although this is a long shot) that nicotine adheres to this principle, and therefore that vaporized salt nicotine is less easily absorbed than vaporized freebase nicotine.

I have done my best to research this on my own, unfortunately the majority of the content to which I have access is considered unreliable by other members of e-cig communities on reddit, in spite of the fact that, as best I can tell, these sources simply state well known chemical principles.

I hope this is an acceptable question to ask on this sub. I am trying to understand how both C cells and Parathyroid chief cells have the same calcium sensitising receptor, yet in a low calcium environment- the chief cells are activated by this receptor, while the C cells are inhibited?

As I understand, binding of calcium to the GPCR causes DAG, IP3 production and a decrease in cAMP. DAG activates PKC, which increases cytoplasmic calcium and alters physiological processes via phosphorylation of proteins. IP3 causes calcium release from the ER.   
While I understand that these processes occur, I do not understand how they lead to the results they do, particularly since they lead to different results in different cells...

I am working with an enzyme that cleaves the D-ribose of a special nucleoside. The nucleoside is pretty expensive and I was asked to do kinetics for it.

For example, would 1uM of enzyme to 10uM substrate be equal to 10uM of enzyme to 100uM substrate. I am asking because the nucleoside is fairly expensive and the colorimetric assay I am using to detect D-ribose is not as sensitive towards the lower uM amounts.

there's a thing I cannot wrap my head around.

According to my knowledge, mercaptoethanol breaks disulfide bonds between cysteines. 
That's where my confusion begins. If mercaptoethanol breaks the disulfide bonds, how do I get two grafts when no peptide bond is broken? Or does it mean there are two peptides connected via sulphur (but that wouldn't make it a tetrapeptide?) ?

Kidneys could be trapped into a process of continually excreting and reabsorbing the same substances until the cells become exhausted or so full of recycled particles that conventional waste can no longer be excreted.

It's definitely not dye from clothing, and not chromhidosis as my skin and sweat is not blue. There are a lot of theory's on the Internet about this, but no real answers as to why. One theory that seems most likely is that there is something in my sweat/ body chemistry that is interacting with the silver particles in the anti microbial coating of the toilet seat.

Other than pregnant women, the couple other ""victims"" that commented all had auto immune diseases as well. Unfortunately they didn't list the medications they were taking. From what I can remember, the blue toilet seat seems to correlate with when I was taking higher doses of prednisone.

- Adacel - pregnancy category C - Each 0.5 mL dose contains 5 Lf tetanus toxoid (T), 2 Lf diphtheria toxoid (d), and acellular pertussis antigens [2.5 mcg detoxified pertussis toxin (PT), 5 mcg filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA), 3 mcg pertactin (PRN), 5 mcg fimbriae types 2 and 3 (FIM)].

I'm particularly unfamiliar with the difference between aluminum phosphate and hydroxide and the effects of glutaraldehyde, tween 80 and 2-phenoxyethanol when injected.

Unfortunately, Unfortunately, randomized double blind trials rarely involve expecting mothers for obvious ethical reasons.

So if one particular cell has receptors for say, two different hormones which act via the same second messenger, is there any way that the cell can distinguish the two stimuli? I‚Äôm guessing there must be some distinguish between the two, otherwise, wouldn‚Äôt the effect of both the hormones be the same?

Biochemistry,"Hi all, I was wondering if anyone would be able to give me fairly basic info on mutagenic primer design. I'll quickly lay out what I'm working on first, then go into what I'm having trouble with. 

I'm a fourth year student, I have a lab based module this year. My project involves inducing point mutations to an RNA binding protein, to hopefully eliminate its RNA binding capacity. I'm working on primer design at the moment. I've identified a highly conserved domain, of 54 residues/162 base pairs. This agrees with a paper I've read that identifies a homologous domain in Drosophila as the key binding domain.

Within this hypothetical binding domain, there's a stretch of 9 codons at the 5' end which encode near-100% conserved amino acids. There are other near-100% conserved residues dispersed more or less evenly along the rest of the domain. 

The highly conserved residues are many positively charged amino acids, which would suggest they contribute strongly to binding, but there are also a few tyrosines, glutamic acids, leucines and threonines. 

My supervisor wants me to mutate the key residues that I think will eliminate binding, with primers &lt;50 in length. 

So, my questions: How many mismatches can I have on each primer before they're ineffective? 

Would it be possible to look at leaving an overhang on the 5' end of a primer, and design the other to fit where the overhang would end in a fully cloned, ligated plasmid? (i.e. instead of trying to mutate bases within the primer, simply design the primer to anneal 4 triplets upstream of where the other primer will anneal, so that the 4 triplets will be ""deleted"" and my 4 triplet overhang will be ""inserted""?

Should I focus solely on 100% conserved basic amino acids, or am I right in thinking that I should try to mutate other residues too (e.g. glutamic acid may mediate the binding somehow, so that may need mutation too?)

My goal is to transfer to the University of Maryland to pursue a career in Plant Biology, and then move on to earn my doctorate in something related to Plant Physiology. I am very passionate about chemistry, biology, and botany. However, this semester has been my most difficult semester so far; precalculus 2, physics 111, and Gen Chem 2. So far I am receiving decent grades, but have just taken my first chem exam after days of studying equilibrium, pH, pOH, Ka Kb Kw, using mass action equation to solve for Q and K, hydrolysis of salts, writing acid base ionization reactions, identifying conjugate acid and base pairs, classifying acids and bases based on their molecular structure (electronegativity and size of atomic radii, and how they pertain to the H-bond of the acid) and I know for sure that I performed poorly. I am prepared to accept a low to mid C.

Biochemistry,"Hello there. I'd like to have fresh/expert eyes to help see if there's anything wrong with my understanding of PKU. I couldn't really find sources that went on a deep level of PKU, so I was hoping one of you knew about PKU. 

Basically, from what I understand, Phenylalanine is one of the amino acids that can't be broken down in people with PKU (Phenylketonuria). When Phenylalanine is able to be broken down by Phe hydroxylase enzyme, Phenylalanine becomes Tyrosine, which eventually turns into Melanin, an essential component of our skin and eyes. But in people with PKU, they lack the Phe hydroxylase enzymes to break down the Phe. As a result, the Phe amino acids aren't broken down and instead become Phenylpyruvate. Phenylpyruvate essentially prohibits the pyruvate transporter (the intermediate for glucose and mitochondrion) from functioning and thus prevents glucose from reaching the mitochondrion. Without glucose, the cell isn't able to produce ATP/energy.

###What is it?

The dataset used is Semantic Scholar's corpus of research paper (https://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/ ), and was trained by a Word2Vec-based algorithm to develop an embedding for each paper. The database contains over 2 million papers from MedLine. You can put 1 or more (as many as you want) papers and the recommender will return the most similar papers to those papers. You can also make TSNE maps of those recommendations.

https://i.imgur.com/OCgp0MV.jpg

###Where is it?

https://github.com/Santosh-Gupta/Research2Vec/blob/master/MedLineResearch2VecPublicPlayGroundV2.ipynb

Or direct look to Google Colab

https://colab.research.google.com/github/Santosh-Gupta/Research2Vec/blob/master/MedLineResearch2VecPublicPlayGroundV2.ipynb

###What can you do with it ?

You can input a paper, and see what are the most similar papers to it, though the first 30-80 will most likely be papers it has cited or was cited by. I've set it to return 300 papers but it ranks all 1,666,577 papers so you can set it to return whatever number of papers you want without any change in performance (except when it comes to developing the TSNE maps)

Now, the fun part: utilization the embedding properties:

You can see a TSNE map of how those similar papers are related to each other. The TSNE takes a while to process for 500 points (10-20 minutes). You can decrease the number of papers for a speedup, or increase the number of papers but that'll take more time.

You can input several papers by adding the embeddings, and get recommendations for combined papers, just add the embeddings for all the papers (you don't have to average them since the embeddings are normalized ). 

Finally, my favorite part, you can get TSNE maps of the recommendations for the combined papers are well. 

**A great use case would be if you're writing a paper, or plan to do some research and would like to check if someone has already done something similar. You can input all the papers you cited or would like to cite, and look over the recommendations.** 

### How important is this ?

When I was in R&amp;D, we spent a lot of time reinventing the wheel; a lot of techniques, methods, and processes that we developed were already pioneered or likely pioneered. But we weren't able to look for them, mainly due to not hitting the right keyword/phrasing in our queries.

There's a lot of variation in terms which can make finding papers for a particular concept very tricky at times.

I've seen a few times someone release a paper, and someone else point out someone has implemented very similar concepts in a previous paper.

Even the Google Brain team has trouble looking up all instances of previous work for a particular topic. A few months ago they released a paper of Swish activation function and people pointed out others have published stuff very similar to it.

&gt; ""As has been pointed out, we missed prior works that proposed the same activation function. The fault lies entirely with me for not conducting a thorough &gt;enough literature search. My sincere apologies. We will revise our paper and give credit where credit is due.""

https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/773epu/r_swish_a_selfgated_activation_function_google/dojjag2/

So if this is something that happens to the Google Brain team, not being able to find all papers on a particular topic is something all people are prone too.

Here's an example of two papers whose authors didn't know about each other until they saw each other on twitter, and they posted papers on nearly the exact same idea, which afaik are the only two papers on that concept.

Word2Bits - Quantized Word Vectors

https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.05651

Binary Latent Representations for Efficient Ranking: Empirical Assessment

https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.07479

Exact same concept, but two very different ways of descriptions and terminology.

###How do I use it ?

Here's a quick video demonstration:

https://youtu.be/Y-O0wbsg_kY

I tried to make this user friendly and as fast to figure out and run as possible, but there's probably stuff I didn't take into account. Let me know of you have any questions on how to run it or any feedback. If you want, you can just give me what papers you want to analyze and I'll do it for you (look up the papers on https://www.semanticscholar.org/ first )

Here's a step by step guide to help people get started

**Step 1:** 

Run the Section 1 of code in the Colab notebook. This will download the model and the dictionaries for the titles, Ids, and links. 

https://snag.gy/rmoCXO.jpg

**Step 2:**

Find the papers want to find similar papers for at Semantic Scholar https://www.semanticscholar.org

Get either the title or Semantic Scholar's paperID, which is the last section of numbers/letters in the link. For example, in this link

https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Distributed-Representations-of-Sentences-and-Le-Mikolov/9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3

The Semantic Scholar paper ID is '9abbd40510ef4b9f1b6a77701491ff4f7f0fdfb3'

Use the title(s) and/or Semantic Scholar's paperID(s) with Section 2 and Section 3 to get the EmbedID from the model. EmbedIDs are how the model keeps track of each paper (not the paperID). 

https://i.imgur.com/0yAQEZl.jpg

The EmbedID is what each dictionary first returns. 

**Step 3:**

In Section 4, insert the EmbedID(s) as the values of paper1EmbedID, paper2EmbedID, paper3EmbedID, paper4EmbedID, etc. 

https://snag.gy/AzeP91.jpg

If you have less than or more than 4 papers you want to analyze, change these lines 

    extracted_v = paper1 + paper2 #+ paper3 + paper4  #Don't need to average since vectors are normalized 
    extracted_vSM = paper1SM #+ paper2SM + paper3SM + paper4SM  #Don't need to average since vectors are normalized 

and create or eliminate the lines of code for vector extraction

    paper1 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper1EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper2 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper2EmbedID , axis=0) 
    paper3 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper3EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper4 = np.take(final_embeddings, paper4EmbedID , axis=0) 
    
    paper1SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper1EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper2SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper2EmbedID , axis=0) 
    paper3SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper3EmbedID , axis=0)   
    paper4SM = np.take(final_embeddingsSM, paper4EmbedID , axis=0) 

Finally, run Section 5 to get a TSNE map of the recommendations. With 300 papers, it takes 15-18 minutes for the map to be produced. 

**Ask any question you have no matter how minor, I want people to use this as quickly as possible with as little time as possible figuring out what to do.** 

### Other details

So it probably doesn't have any papers released in the last 5 months; I think the corpus was last updated in March 2018. Due to the limitation on my computational resources (Google Colab) I had to filter towards more papers with more connections to other papers in the database. A connection is either a citation to another paper in the database, or cited by another paper in the database. I filtered to only include papers with 50 or more connections because Colab would crash if I tried to include more. 

As of right now, the recommender has 2,096,359 papers. I hope to make future versions with more many more papers, including papers from other fields. 

### Feedback greatly appreciated !

I am hoping to get as much feedback as possible. I am specifically looking for cases where you feel that the recommender should have given a particular paper in the top results, but didn't. I am hoping to make an evaluation toolkit that I can use to tune the hyperparameters.

Im phd student in organic chemistry and, honestly, my biology/biochem knowledge is pretty bad.

But what If I wanted to make a non-peptide compound that is produced by pathogen (to be further modified into the therapeutic) ? Harvesting the compound from the pathogen is just not suitable for obvious reasons. Making it chemicaly is possible in like 15 steps which is not really suitable for the task.

Biochemistry,"This is just me thinking aloud and I think it might be beneficial to give a little background to this idea. Last year I finished my bachelor thesis working with Locusta migratoria, a grasshopper that is infamous for it's destructive plagues. We synthesized mRNA complementary to certain transcripts that played a role in the maturation of these insects, with the goal of stopping them from achieving their mature stadium. No mature stadium means no wings, which means no plagues. The problem with this of course is that we don't know whether or if you can successfully administer this mRNA on a large scale in the wild. Studies have shown that the mRNA does do it's job when administered topically, so theoretically you could spray large quantities of mRNA into the wild like you would with pesticides (further complications arise with the unstiability of the mRNA of course). The obvious pro to this is that it is extremely specific to species and similar effect have been seen in multiple species of not only grasshoppers but also beetles, flies, etc.
So that is my first question, does anyone think this is feasable?

First, on his PowerPoint, he says Substrate Inhibition can also be called End Product Inhibition. Then, the concentration of a final product in pathway inhibits an enzyme earlier in the sequence.

He then defines Allosteric Inhibition as ""the mechanism by which an end product inhibits an enzyme"" then goes on to clarify it does this by ""bind[ing] to a site on the enzyme, separate from the active site""

These seem to be the exact same thing to me according to his definitions. When I googled, I got that substrate inhibition is not end product inhibition.

Biochemistry,"This is an extract from Lehninger's principles of biochemistry 5ed: 

""Citrate (the ionized form of citric acid), a key intermediate

in the aerobic oxidation of pyruvate, fatty

acids, and amino acids, is also an allosteric regulator of

PFK-1; high citrate concentration increases the inhibitory

effect of ATP, further reducing the flow of glucose

through glycolysis. In this case, as in several

others encountered later, citrate serves as an intracellular

signal that the cell is meeting its current needs for

energy-yielding metabolism by the oxidation of fats

and proteins.""

My question is: where does citrate come from?, I think citrate concentration rises when there's an energy surplus and the cell (hepatocyte) is making fatty acids because citrate is involved in the export of acetyl-CoA from mitochondria to the cytosol for it's for fatty acid synthesis but this pathway is only active when fatty acids are being made and not when the cell is using (beta oxidation) because of the carnitine shuttle which is inhibited by malonyl-CoA. I know this effect might be small in comparison to the action of insulin or glucagon via FBPase-2 and PFK-2 but still it puzzles me what this citrate is doing.",PFK-1 allosteric regulation by citrate question

Biochemistry,"Hey Biochemists of Reddit!

Doing a basic biochemistry-lab-course at my university about enzymatic reactions, I had to measure some thermodynamic parameters of LDH and GAPDH. Therefore I measured the equilibrium-concentrations (UV/VIS) of many (8-10) reaction-assays and calculated the equilibrium constant. Nothing special....But....
Since both katalysed reactions of the LDH and GAP-DH involve protons, how does the pH influence the equilibrium constante?
The measured assays had different concentrations and puffered pH-values (7 - 8.5). Following the instructions of the lab-cours protocol I were told to set the proton concentration of the GAP-DH reaction to 1 and the concentration of the LDH reaction to 10^(-pH). Unfortunately there was not any explaination why. I have to mention that both results of the constant were not that bad (according to profs).
Furthermore I know about the biochemical thermodynamic convention that one can set the H+ concentration at pH=7 to [H+]=1. But why did we measure this two enzyms in a different way?

- Cells have sodium and potassium pumps to balance out the concentration of sodium and potassium on both sides to keep the electric resting membrane potential.

Biochemistry,"Hi everyone,  


My lab designs potential metabolic probes for molecular imaging (similar to PET tracers), and one of the most exciting breakthroughs lately has been that N-acetylated (and N-ethyl) group amino acids might be perfect for our application. I've been doing exhaustive searches trying to find out more information about how delivered N-acetylated amino acids are metabolized, but most studies focus on the acetylation process itself. Sometimes I will see clues such as papers stating that mono-, di-, and tri-methylated glycine is very common and rapidly metabolized back to glycine, but I haven't found a good resource for acetylation, other amino acids, etc.  


So my questions are essentially:   


1) does anyone have a good resource for determining whether N-acetyl and N-ethyl amino acids are cleaved to their native structures, or biologically inactive/purged from the cell?  


2) And perhaps most importantly, is anyone aware of work commenting on how different rates of deacetylation might be diagnostic of diseased tissue ie. cancer, such as profiling a tumor site by upregulated deacetylases and hydroxylases which cleave N-acetyl amino acids are unique rates.  


**tl;dr; how can I confirm what happens to N-acetylated and N-ethyl amino acids injected into a patient, and whether they are cleaved to normal structures. Also whether this is useful in cancer metabolism.**

For background, I am so fascinated by nutritional biochemistry and metabolism. As for why I'm not just completing a degree in nutrition... I've chosen to veer away from it because there's a lot of social science requirements related to nutrition counseling that I'm just not interested in. I plan to take courses in macro\- and micro\-nutrient metabolism, nutrition and disease, anatomy and physiology, etc. but also want to know what other courses will be essential if I hope to someday work as a biochemist. I've already taken the general biology, chemistry, organic chemistry sequence/labs, etc. I (think?) I've secured a position to help out in a faculty member's lab next semester, and have plans to complete research project or honor's thesis. 

I'd like to think this educational path I've had provides me a unique perspective about science, medicine, and health, but at the same time I'm concerned that it's not \*rigorous enough\* for the kind of research that I'd like to do. 

In short \-\- does major choice matter if I'm looking to work in the industry or in labs? If it doesn't, what courses do you recommend that I take to be considered competent? Anything else you reccomend? Thank you :\-)","Hoping to work as a biochemist, but not majoring in it. How important is this?"

    Describe the essential features of a plasmid-based expression vector for use in mammalian cells and discuss the techniques available to ‚Äòengineer‚Äô novel proteins

The essence of cell chemistry is to isolate a particular cellular component and then analyze its chemical structure and activity.
However, even the genomes of simple organisms are much too complex to analyze in detail, let alone more complex ognanisms.
The obstacle to obtaining pure DNA samples from large genomes has been overcome by recombinant DNA technology.
With these methods nearly any gene can be targeted, its sequence determined, and the desired functional regions of the sequence reintroduced into cells and into whole organisms.
The DNA must been screened, this will identify your target gene. 
Now a restriction enzyme can be used to remove the target gene, often resulting in sticky ends.
The plasmid is then cut using the same restriction enzyme to ensure your gene can assimilate into the plasmid.
The sticky ends are forced to bind by an enzyme called DNA ligase.
Heat shock target cells which allows you to insert the vector into the cell via the membrane. 
The cell will perform standard DNA replication, including the target gene and producing the protein that was desired.
























Q3.    Describe how you would synthesise cDNA from a sample of total RNA obtained from muscle. Give examples of how you could use genetic engineering to facilitate the construction of a cDNA library from your muscle cDNA and briefly describe how you might screen the library to identify the full-length actin cDNA if you were given an actin EST


Using your RNA sample, you need to remove introns and add a poly-A tail and a 5‚Äô Methyl-Guanine cap (these steps are known as post-transcriptional modification)
To separate the mature RNA you carry out an affinity chromatography assay (the poly-A tail acts as a binding point to attach the RNA to the ‚Äúbeads‚Äù used in the assay)
A poly-T oligonucleotide primer is hybridized onto the poly-A tail. Reverse transcriptase is then added with deoxynucleotide triphosphates (A,T,G,C). This allows a strand of DNA that compliments the RNA to be formed. 
The RNA is then digested using RNase H to leave a single stranded DNA molecule. This ssDNA is very hydrophobic and so forms a ‚Äúhairpin loop‚Äù. 
DNA polymerase is then added. The hairpin loop acts as a primer, and the ssDNA becomes double stranded. 
This dsDNA will be an identical sequence to the original RNA

Biochemistry,"Hey guys, 

I'd like to add an unnatural amino acid to an envelope protein of HIV. GP120.   I'd like to conjugate this protein with an exosome, which I've transfected to contain a Cas9/GuideRNA targeting a specific region of the CD4 cell. I'd like to see if my GP120-exosome construct, will have a propensity to transfect the CD4 cells more efficiently. I'm hoping that the GP120 will bind to the CCR5 surface receptor of the CD4 and statistically spend more time ""near"" the cell. Enough time for the exosome to merge with the CD4 cell to release its contents. 

However, I'm not familiar with adding unnatural amino acids to proteins. The reason I need an unnatural amino acids to be incorporated into GP120 is because I need native function to be 100% retained. If I conjugate using the native amino acids, I'm worried that the function of the envelope protein will be lost.

I am very confused. I enjoy both (?), and I was wondering if what they said was true. Could you help me understand the difference between BC and MB, especially by way of your own experience? Would you recommend dropping the Chinese Major to a minor in order to become pure BC?

Biochemistry,"From Bill Bryson:



No one really knows, but there may be as many as a million types of protein in the human body, and each one is a little miracle. By all the laws of probability proteins shouldn't exist. To make a protein you need to assemble amino acids‚Ä¶in a particular order, in much the same way that you assemble letters in a particular order to spell a word. [For example, to make collagen,] you need to arrange 1,055 amino acids in precisely the right sequence‚Ä¶.

The chances of a 1,055-sequence molecule like collagen spontaneously self-assembling are, frankly, nil. It just isn't going to happen. To grasp what a long shot its existence is, visualize a standard Las Vegas slot machine but broadened greatly‚Äîto about ninety feet, to be precise‚Äîto accommodate 1,055 spinning wheels instead of the usual three or four, and with twenty symbols on each wheel (one for each common amino acid). How long would you have to pull the handle before all 1,055 symbols came up in the right order? Effectively forever. Even if you reduced the number of spinning wheels to two hundred, which is actually a more typical number of amino acids for a protein, the odds against all two hundred coming up in a prescribed sequence are 1 in 10^260 (that is 1 followed by 260 zeros). That in itself is a larger number than all the atoms in the universe‚Ä¶.

Yet we are talking about several hundred thousand types of protein, perhaps a million, each unique and each, as far as we know, vital to the maintenance of a sound and happy you.",How did proteins come about?

Biochemistry,"A text I am reading says

""GLUT2 is a low-affinity transporter in hepatocytes and pancreatic cells. After a meal, blood travels through the hepatic portal vein and GLUT 2 captures excess glucose for storage.

When concentration drops below Km, much of the remainder bypasses the liver and enters circulation. The Km of GLUT2 is quite high so the liver will pick up glucose in proportion to its concentration in the blood"".

I know Km is a measure indirectly of binding affinity.

Rate also is based on concentration so at a higher concentration the rate is higher.

But the passage seems to be saying that at low Km, most of the glucose will not be transported, while at high glucose concentrations, more will be transported.

**But i thought Km was a constant so I am confused. Is it because we are dealing with a transporter? So by it's function, more will be transported at higher concentrations but the binding affinity is the same?**

This is in comparison to Glut4, where the Km is very low, so it binds very strongly to glucose. So the passage says it gets saturated very easily. But Glut4 is also unique in that it's expression can be unregulated. Is that how the body compensates? And why it makes sense that Glut4 has such a low Km because it is expressed in muscle and fat?

Biochemistry,"Hi,

I want to acquire dextro-naltrexone so I can perform a trial on its effectiveness in treating disease.

Naltrexone is an effective novel anti-inflammatory which seems to help with many autoimmune conditions. Interest in it for this use has grown massively over the past decade. Here's a journal article about this:

https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10067-014-2517-2

And here's a quote from the above article:

&gt; The hypothesis that naltrexone and naloxone operate via glial cells to exert their beneficial actions is supported by work with dextro-naltrexone. Dextro-naltrexone is a stereoisomer of naltrexone which is active at microglia receptors but has no activity on opioid receptors [26]. Dextro-naltrexone possesses analgesic and neuroprotective properties [27]. Therefore, the analgesic, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective effects of naltrexone do not appear to be dependent on opioid receptors.

Basically, if you read the discussion boards where LDN (low dose naltrexone) is discussed, you'll quickly realize that (1) it's a very effective treatment, probably due to the microglia receptor effects and (2) the side effects can be very prohibitive for a large number of people, and the are probably due to the opioid receptor effects.

So, I'd like to acquire and try dextro-naltrexone.

It is very easy to source a racemic mixture from China, but I don't know how to go about extracting out just the dextro- isomer. I would like to pay a lab or a chemist with access to a lab to do this.

Is anyone here interested? Does anyone know where I might be able to find someone? You would be contributing to the sum knowledge of humanity and helping to improve the quality of life enjoyed by hundreds of thousands of chronically ill individuals.

I've asked each of my biochemistry professors this question as it becomes relevant as I pass through the ranks of the required courses, but I still haven't really found a solid answer. I suppose it's a pretty specific question, and none of the faculty engage in polymerase research.

It's very common to learn that DNA polymerase requires a free 3' OH group to add onto to catalyze nucleotide (DTP's) polymerization. In turn, it's also commonly taught that RNA polymerase can 'spontaneously' catalyze the polymerization of ribose nucleotides (from NTP's).

My question is, why. What differs in the relevant catalytic domains of RNA polymerase from those of DNA polymerase? I've been looking at both sites in PyMol and I'm having trouble understanding the relevant AA chemistry that confers such an advantage on RNA polymerase.

The evolutionary reason, assuming RNA was the original genetic code/catalytic molecule, is pretty clear I think. DNA pol evolved in the presence of an RNA pol already capable of freely initiating nucleotide polymerization, so there was no strong pressure to develop a domain that could also do that.

Does sigma 54 somehow become upregulated? I can't see any reason sigma 24 would be involved until the temperature goes up to extreme levels of heat shock, when I assume sigma 32 would become even more transcriptionally active.

I can find pretty much no information other than a 1989 paper speculating that the increase in temperature affects DNA supercoiling to increase activity associated with one of the sigma 70 promoters, but that was a long time ago and the authors don't seem to be aware of sigma 24 or 54 promotors of the rpoH gene, so it seems like there should possibly be more current information available somewhere I'm not looking (mostly pubmed and general internet searches).",What causes increased transcription of sigma 32 during heat shock response in E. coli?

Biochemistry,"Excuse my na√Øvet√© on the subject, I have not had to design an experiment utilizing FRET and my knowledge on the technique is limited.

Often in FRET two different GFP proteins are used. My understanding is that these GFP proteins are added to the genetic sequence (via recombinant DNA editing?) and then the recombinant proteins are expressed and then tested. If there is a misconception on my part please clear this up for me.

Are bioconjugation techniques ever used as opposed to recombinant protein expression? 

Obviously the drawback is that you're relying on a separate set of chemical reactions and can't be as sure what residue the GFP protein attaches too. Perhaps a bioconjugation strategy using antibodies for the motifs in question might be appropriate? 

I was thinking that it might be difficult for the protein to fold properly if a huge GFP protein is on a residue near the active site. In addition to eliminating issues folding properly, a bioconjugation strategy may give rise to using small molecule fluorephores instead.

Biochemistry,"Hi everyone,

I just recently conducted an experiment in my biochemistry class where we had to add DNA to distilled water, isotonic saline and 2.5M NaCl. I noticed different physical aspects depending on the solvent, but I'm not sure how I would categorize them. Here's what I saw:

- Distilled: fibrous precipitate, cloudy liquid
- Isotonic: Honestly barely noticed a change here? Maybe I wasn't looking hard enough
- 2.5M: salt precipitate at the bottom and fibres

I know DNA is polar so solubility should increase as the polarity of the solvent increases. But to my recollection what I saw in 2.5M saline vs distilled water did not differ much. However, there is always the possibility that I could have made some experimental errors that led to inaccurate observations.

Biochemistry,"Hello world

I'm a recent medical school graduate, and currently completing my residency in genetics.

I intend to apply for a position in a gene therapy lab, by the end of this year, for a duration of 6 months. Ultimately, cell &amp; gene therapy would be my career choice.

However, I have no background in experimental biology, ie the technical / bench aspect of molecular &amp; cell biology. My background is basically all theory (and clinical medicine ... which might not help much ...).

Therefore, I am looking for some solid material that could to introduce me to experimental technique. Especially, given the field I would be working in, I'm guessing cell culture, induction of stem cells, use of viral vectors, basic molecular genetics protocols (PCR, RT PCR, Blots, ...).

I have found the following book which looks promising, although supposes the reader has some very basic lab knowledge :

Once again, I have no prior lab experience, so something in the style of ""for dummies"" would be ideal. I would not underestimate the value of basic sections such as pipeting, centrifugation, etc.

&gt; - Dependent on Free-Energy between bound-like encounter-complex and non-bound-like encounter-complex. 
&gt;
&gt;**Conformational Selection**: Conformation Changes, then ligand binds. 
&gt;
&gt; - Dependent on Free-Energy between non-bound-like apo and bound-like encounter-complex 

I thought *apo* just meant unbound and *encounter-complex* just meant bound, but there's clearly some subtly I'm missing because I have no idea what a *non-bound-like encounter-complex* would be. Supposing encounter complex just means the ligand is near by, I can make sense of the induced fit dependency, but then shouldn't conformational selection be between *non-bound-like apo* and some sort of *bound-like apo*, where apo would just mean not with the ligand? 

I guess I'm not clear enough on my definitions here. 

*Edit:* Is it just because (if you look at their diagram that I just noticed) it's going across the entire pathway? Where as for induced fit the free energy between non-bound-like apo and non-bound-like encounter-complex is assumed to be low or even negative?

Biochemistry,"Our lab currently has two FPLCs, a two year old Akta Start and an 11 year old Akta Explorer (w/ Frac 950).

Nowadays the Explorer has been mostly retired, and is only used for SEC. 


We're looking to purchase a new FPLC, as parts to replace our Explorer's failing pumps are becoming harder to find. Ideally we would like an instrument that only does SEC. Neither Bio-Rad or GE offer a FPLC &lt;$40K that only does SEC. If you want to do SEC, you need the Akta Pure or NGC Quest which I believe are quoted $40K and over.

2. I see that KRAS (from the wiki page) is on the 12th chromosome. How do you go from bulk DNA to being able to pin down to the 12th chromosome? Do you just sequence the entire chromosome or all of that person's DNA and just figure out where the KRAS gene starts and ends? Or is there some way to extract KRAS alone (if so, how is that?)

3. How can they differentiate good KRAS from mutant KRAS?

4. Is this the same way you look for mutations in the BRCA gene for breast cancer? How do researchers know where to look for these genes, or how do they separate them from tissue? How were they able to figure out that mutations in this gene correlates well with breast cancer?

Biochemistry,"Hello everyone!

As the tile says, I am a high school student in the 11th grade (that's the second year to last... I am not sure if all countries count grades in the same way) from Romania and I intend to study biochemistry, but I am not sure if it's the right degree choice for me. I've focused in the last 2 years on chemistry, biology, math, earth science and physics, but especially on organic chemistry. I am lucky to have a teacher that works a few hours per week with me after classes and the opportunity to participate in multiple organic chemistry contests where I can test my knowledge. This means I spend a lot of my spare time studying for chemistry (which I absolutely love), so I was thinking what university degree would be the most suitable for me. 

My first though was biochemistry because it satisfies my love for chemistry, interest in genetics and it can lead to a job in research (I've always loved working in the lab). I want to move and study in the UK, so the first thing I did was to check if any university has a recommended books page for students in the first year of university. I ended up getting my hands on a biochemistry textbook (""Biochemistry"" by Voet&amp;Voet); skimming though it in the last 2 months I discovered that biochemistry is less about chemistry (or better said the chemistry I am used to) that I expected.

So, here are my questions. Did I pick the wrong book? There are jobs in the biochemistry field more chemistry focused? What areas should I research more in order to be prepared for future interviews? Would you suggest me another degree?

How have you come to understand the variables of GFE, both conceptually and mathematically? And the equation as a whole?


* The variables themselves are complex concepts - enthalpy, entropy, and temperature. Well, maybe not so much temperature. But still. What does ŒîG‚Äã mean to you, as a biochemist? An inorganic chemist, physicist, etc. may have a different kind of perspective.



**I'm curious about how you explain the equation to yourself, in your own terms. Your explanation does not have to resemble mine - feel free to bring a whole new idea to the table.**



* For me, I think the example of the reversible reaction of protein folding/unfolding is a great model of GFE.

Biochemistry,"A little while ago I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskScienceDiscussion/comments/7bwpyo/is_there_a_way_to_quantitatively_measure_an/) in r/AskScienceDiscussion about a way to quantify an organism's perception of time, or 'latency' to their sensory input. I propose this would be directly related to the complexity of an organism, defined by the number of chemical steps it takes between sensory input and cognition. Obviously, that definition is not something we could readily count in an organism (to my knowledge?).   

I got one answer that gave me some food for thought, and until recently it's been on the back of my mind. Today I was preparing for a presentation I have this week, and I was using a figure from a *Cell* snapshot to get my point across. [This](http://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(16)30208-2.pdf) is the publication I was using (if it's a broken link, I apologize, it is titled ""Snapshot: Timescales in Cellular Biology,"" -- a Google search should bring it up), and at the bottom it has a very interesting point regarding the response time of Olympic athletes to a starter pistol. It says:  

&gt; Upon hearing the shot, athletes process and propagate an electric impulse from the brain all the way to their feet (1 m). Considering the speed of the action potential (10‚Äì100 m/s), this implies a latency of 10‚Äì100 ms regardless of other processes, such as the speed of sound and signal processing in the brain. The best athletes respond after 120 ms, and a reaction time below 100 ms is immediately disqualified as a false start.  

This is the only thing I have found on the topic, but it's a very interesting thought IMO. That is to say that a(n) (elite) human (at their physical prime) takes a minimum of 10-100 ms to react consciously to sensory input (different from reflex, for example). So we as humans have a latency: an inherent period of time it takes physical sensory input to be loaded into a human's consciousness, presumably based on the number of chemical steps in between input and cognition.   

This doesn't say much of my other line of questioning: mainly, that we (all life) must have some temporal *resolution*, a minimum period of time that we can sense something as having occurred.  

Has anyone else thought of something like this, or stumbled upon anything in the literature that talks about this? It has been increasingly preoccupying my thoughts lately, would love to hear someone else's input.",Reaction Time of Olympic Athletes as an Inherent Latency For Sensory Input

At this point I genotyped them for my cre (the primers of which are identical for both tissues), and the flox, and despite the parents being homozygous flox their offspring showed variously sized bands with my flox primers.

Naturally I took these results and went back to figure out what went wrong, and realized I'd mixed up a (+) for a (-) a few months ago with the female I used to breed. I know these pups are not going to be experimentally useful, but I'm curious about what theoretically could have happened with two cre's acting simultaneously on one flox'd gene.

I haven't found much literature on this phenomenon, probably because it's the result of an error and doesn't lead anywhere productive. But does anyone know what happened to produce these variable bands? Could one cre have cut one site and the other cut the other?",What can happen if you breed two mice with different cre's but the same flox?

Biochemistry,"Hi,

I've been making peptides using solid phase peptide synthesis and then cyclizing by forming a disulfide bond between two cysteine residues. The way I've been doing this is by adding a low concentration of 4,4-dithiopyridine in methanol to the peptide in acetonitrile/water. This has been working for several years without a problem. 

Lately however, there's been a problem where rather than PDS adding to one cysteine, then being replaced by the sulfur on the other cysteine (ideal) it is just adding to both cysteines and no further reaction occurs. This means that rather than cyclizing my peptides are just coming out with a mass +220 for PDS, and I don't know why.",Peptide cyclization problems?

I'm currently a student at the University of Tampa doing Bsc Biochemistry.

Biochemistry,"Hey all. So in textbooks it is said that carbohydrates, and protein yield the same amount of ATP / kilojoules. This is wrong on the face of it. 

Proteins main job is as structural material to make up organs. It's main job is not to undergo gluceoneogenesis nor to feed into krebs cycle intermediates. 

Lets assume 5% of ingested protein goes to gluceo neogenesis. So that yields 1/20 of the ATP ingesting carbohydrates would. 

Glucose to pyruvate yields a small amount of ATP, with the bulk of ATP coming from NADH made from krebs cycle going into the electron transport chain. The further around krebs cycle an amino acid feeds into then the less NADH, and then ATP that will be made.

https://archive.cnx.org/resources/c2f3048fbb77b49612cd1cf311884b257a3375c3/Figure_07_06_01.jpg

Lets assume 1% of ingested protein feeds into krebs cycle. So we have 6% protein total going towards ATP production compared to 100% for ingested carbohydrates.

Whoever invented the low carb diet whether it was Robert Atkins or someone before him appears to have designed a diet with the intention of killing people by depriving them off their main energy source. And now low protein fat diets are everywhere, with lots of variations. 

Mans man fuel source is long chains of glucose molecules aka starch aka complex carbohydrates. Not protein. So get stuck into that breakfast cereal or rice or some other starchy food to feel better. Not a steak (I am not vegan just realised what a scam the low carb fad is).

So, I was admitted to a program at my university which upon completion would award me with both a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science, however I fell quite ill my final year of high school which resulted in me not completing the prerequisites for the BSc, so I am finishing up those now, while getting the annoying general ed courses out of the way. 

Now do to the nature of the program we are required to choose our major by the end of year one/beginning of year two, and I‚Äôm stuck between deciding between Biology or Biochem.  The reason I ask about employability is that **the Biology concentration I‚Äôm interested in (cell and Molecular biology) is 99% identical to the Biochem program sans ~4 courses.**

Biochem requires an extra term of physics, two terms of Physical chemistry, and a Biochem seminar in the final year. In addition, a lot of courses shared by the two programs are focused more on humans in the biochemistry stream rather than more general organisms in the cell/molecular biology path (Human Physiology vs Vertebrate Physiology, Human cytology vs General cytology, etc...). Either way, I have to take the same number of Biochemistry and organic chemistry courses as part of either stream.

Biochemistry,"Hi i'm a Grad Student in Digital Media. For my masters project, i want to create a microbial fuel cell and produce energy for some kind of machine that should work by a DC motor. ..There are lots of tutorials on the internet concerning microbial fuel cells working on organic matter such as soil or plants as the cell's core material. But i want to create a microbial fuel cell, using E coli bacteria. I know that there have been studys to create microbial fuel cells using waste water, but nothing really detailed about it how it works. So far i know that e coli does not do any photosynthesis, because it is an anaerobic bacteria. Therefore i was looking for what kind of nutritions E coli bacteria is using and how it is transforming it in its metabolism.
As E Coli is a Bacteria, and therfore a microorganism, according to an article on wikipedia:
When microorganisms consume a substance such as sugar in anerobic conditions, they produce carbon dioxide and especially Electrons and Protons.

My questions therefore: When E choli bacteria is transforming Glucose (nutrition) within its metabolism, are there any Electrons released during that process, which can be used for collecting with an anode? 

Or is it H+ Protons that are being released? 
If H+ Protons are released during the metabolism, can these H+ Protons be used to create a current with a cathode and a corresponding anode?

On Youtube, there are several tutorials on how to create a microbial fuel cell using soil. Some of them are not using any saltbridges for electron exchanges or Membranes for Proton exchanges and they are working totally fine.
If the Glucose metabolism from the E coli bacteria is producing H+ Protons and Protons can be derived through the provided cathode, is there any proton exchange membrane needed or would it produce a current just fine without any proton exchange membranes?
Also according to Wikipedia, which might be useful to know:
Mediatorfree fuel cells work on wastewater, plants and soil, whereas soil is specific, because soil itself acts as its own mediator, its proton exchange membrane, and is also the nutrient-rich anodic media...

So basically a Microbial fuel cell working on E Coli Bacteria should be a combination of soil and wastewater? ...

Biochemistry,"Hey guys, I've asked around reddit a bit but haven't gotten much help. Also have been to a dermatologist and vein specialist without much feedback on my issues since they aren't typical.

My background: M, 5'10, 22, 160 lbs, ~12% BF, fairly good health. I got big ugly puffy bags under my eyes which I am 90% sure are due to taking 8-10g of L citrulline daily for about 3 months, (Stupidly) trying to maximize my lifting. My allergies, sleep, and diet all did not change significantly in that time. I didn't notice them as they crept up over the 3 months since I was wearing glasses for that time period. As soon as I wore contacts for the first time in a while though, I didn't want to go out in public...

I believe taking these relatively high doses of L Citrulline upregulated the levels of Nitric Oxide Synthase (NOS) in my body, which will hopefully fall back down eventually. It has been roughly 3 months since I have touched the L Citrulline since I realized it may have been contributing to my eye bags and they are slightly better, but it seems to be taking a while. As of right now it has been about 5 months that I have looked like a 30 year old drug addict without my glasses, while before I took the Citrulline I had a baby face. If you google a bit you will see that there are a few potential causes:

* Nitric Oxide (NO), a byproduct of citrulline, causes lymphatic flow to be slowed in experiments, so I believe my lymphatic system has been slowed down significantly over the past months but I am hoping it will get back up to speed as my levels of NOS fall back to normal, although it may take several more months.

* NO causes vasodilation, allowing more lymph to exit blood vessels into the interstitial space, which shows up as edema/puffiness/swelling

Anyone who has taken citrulline have similar stories? Or anyone think my logic is right? As I said above, doctors have so far not known what to do. Thanks!

Link to studies:
[NO slows lymph in high concentrations](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3634525/) 

The above basically says that "" higher agonist-evoked concentrations of NO exert purely inhibitory effects on contractile function."" and also that removal of NO increases lymphatic speed, which follows from  the previous statement. The bags I have are definite due to combined slow lymph flow and increased edema since they are worst in morning and reduce over the day as they drain better.

This is what I understand so far (is this correct/what else should I know?):
-MMR repairs non Watson-crick base pairs during DNA replication -When there has been a slippage MMR doesn't know which strand contains the correct DNA information and which does not

 -MutS is involved in mismatch recognition (first stage of MMR)

 -There are two MutS complexes: MutSa (MSH2 + MSH6 = involved in recognising small nucleotide changes) and MutsB (MSH2 +MSH3 = involved in recognising slightly larger nucleotide changes) 

-MutS form a lose clamp around DNA and travel down the helix, when a mismatch is detected it bends DNA (this confrontational change brings about rapid ADP-&gt; ATP exchange and can recruit downstream repair factors

What about this bond makes it so stable? I know, it's the ""polarity"", but what about that makes it so strong? I guess a positive gets to be next to a negative? 

Another question: Hydrogen and Fluorine also form a very strong bond, apparently the second most strong single bond in organic chemistry. And generally, strong bonds result in little reactivity.

There's a good bit of evidence that FQ's inhibit P450 and cause Phase II Detoxification issues, however a new paper that was published states that there's strong evidence that those with FQ 'toxicity' have FQ molecules stuck within the cells. It's likely there's a biological issue here such as polymorphisms causing incorrect/incomplete metabolism of that kind of drug, and people with the chronic side effects cannot 'remove' the FQs from the body, so the effects persist.

My questions is, how would one go about correcting this phenomenon (if it exists)? How would one actually remove accumulated FQ molecules from cells that biological processes can't remove?

Biochemistry,"Hi all. I'll elaborate on my title of the post - I'm an undergrad student with a major in neuroscience, and more recently, a minor in biochemistry

Up until I began taking organic chem-based courses, the majority of my coursework (as a lot of neuro/bio is) was heavy on memorization. You know how some people say that some students just ""get"" organic chemistry, and others really don't? I was the latter case. In my intro ochem course, I quickly realized that my spatial memory sucked - things like understanding how to visualize structures, why mechanisms proceed the way they do, etc were all extremely difficult for me. I scraped by and for some reason decided to take a bioorganic chemistry course.

Here, I was still doing a lot of mechanisms, but I realized that these were the chemical things that underlie all of the stuff I was taught even as far back as freshman year. Stuff like, *that's* why DNA is more stable than RNA? *That's* how viral propagation works at a cellular level? *That's* what cAMP, the thing I've been learning about in G-protein cascades for 3 years, actually looks like? was all super cool to me. I was able to come up with enough tricks to memorize mechanisms and apply them to my tests, and did very well. 

After that, I realized that my research interests in neuropathology went along very well with biochemisty, and declared a minor. I'm currently in an advanced course that covers a lot of material, and my ""memorize it until you kinda get it and maybe end up with the right answer"" strategy is not working that well. All my classmates are biochemistry majors with much more background in chemistry than me, and it shows.

Biochemistry,"Hi all,

I'm an sophomore in undergrad. I came into undergrad with med school in mind, and shadowed and got extensive clinical exposure through volunteering. I wanted to do some research and got involved in an absolutely wonderful lab researching a really interesting topic, and have fallen in love with labwork. I worked in a different biochem lab in high school, obviously with less autonomy and a lower level of understanding of everything, with pretty horrible coworkers, and it really turned me off of research until I got involved in this lab I'm currently in (still loved the content + actual wet work in hs though).

I have considered getting an M.D/Ph.D but I don't think it really appeals to me for a few reasons:

A) The split dedication to two separate major disciplines seems counter productive to me - I would personally rather concentrate my effort toward being the best doctor OR researcher rather than a decent combination of the two.

B) I would be limited in both research and in specialty opportunities, which goes with point A - from what I understand, not many surgeons do lab work due to the time demand, just as not many researchers of extremely intricate topics do extensive clinical work. I'm really not very interested in clinical or translational research.

Time isn't really an issue, as I would either be going to med + residency or doing a PhD, and I really love school. Obviously medicine offers better salary and job security, and a big question of a research career is how lucky + creative I could get in working on a project. I would love to work in a drug discovery lab in industry, and feel that the salary and security with a Ph.D is sufficient for my life style.

I'm doing a some hydrolizations and I'm reading some articles and I'm trying to understand what they mean and I need some help with that. I don't know a lot about enzymes and how they do this simulation but I hope someone here can help me :)

I'm watching a method and they have this:
- E/S (%) = enzyme substrate ratio; percent (w/w) of enzyme (alcalase) added per weight of protein content in the substrate.

So let's imagine, my sample have 58g of protein per 100g. I should put 3% of alcalase (w/w) per weight of protein content, so if I use only 10g of protein:

In 100g I have 50g of protein
If I want 10g of protein I need ~17,24g of the original 100g sample.

So I use 17,24g of sample and I put 0,3g of alcalase? I'm doing this right?
_______

What do they mean with this?
""were washed once with double distilled water and homogenized
using two volumes of water in a commercial blender"", how much is two volumes? Put 2x the original weight in water?

I hope you understand me, my english isn't the best :D

Biochemistry,"Hello everyone, I‚Äôm a sophomore undergraduate biochemistry student, and I had a few questions about the graduate program system as I am unaware of many details. I know many of these questions have been repeatedly asked on this subreddit and apologize for adding to that list.

First off, what is a safe gpa to have to get into top tier schools such as Berkeley, Harvard, San Francisco, etc.
I read in many threads in this subreddit that above 3.3 is a must with decent research background experience.

The second question is what is considered a good amount of research to be known as ‚Äúextensive‚Äù?

Currently I have done about 9 months work with a graduate student and my tasks comprised of calculating nearly all the data required for his thesis paper. He said that he would definitely put my name on his paper and write a letter of recommendation. I‚Äôm not sure if this means being a co-author or being in the special thanks section. What is the value of being in either of those two sections? 

Also currently, I am doing research with a neuroscientist professor and have also submitted an ACUC protocol for a research project that me and my other two lab partners will independently research and then author. Following this is also a presentation of our work at an annual convention in spring quarter. I‚Äôm also planning to do stem cell research and virology research with two other professors starting in the winter quarter of this school year. 

Another question I had is if it is more important doing multiple different research projects, or to focus on one for a long time.

I'm trying to use AutoDock to investigate Polymerase Acidic Protein from influenza (PDB: 3HW4) but am having trouble getting my head around things.

Furthermore, the protein is (AFAIK) a homotetramer, which confuses me even more because subunit C doesn't actually have a ligand bound when imported into AutoDock. I was told to study the subunits in isolation by the module supervisor, but as subunit C is behaving differently to A, B and D, I'm not really sure how to progress.

Biochemistry,"Hey everyone, I've noticed a big influx of high school and undergrads worried about jobs and salaries for biochemistry graduates. I understand it's normal for people to ask these questions, but hopefully this post will give you some guidance and comfort.

I'm a senior studying biochemistry at a nationally recognized public university.

**First**: Start gaining experience as soon as possible. Go through **ALL** the professors in your university's chemistry, biology, biochem, physiology, chemical engineering, etc. departments. Find professor's whose work interests you. Email them, set up appointments, ask questions, etc. You *have* to put yourself out there. 

Don't email ten professors. Email fifty. I'm not joking. You might think this is excessive, but it's not. If you email fifty professors, ten might respond to you. 

**It is possible** for biochem undergrads to get research and job opportunities while still in college. 

**Second**: If you are going into biochem for the **$$$** - stop. Seriously, don't. The curriculum is not easy, especially if you're not interested in it. There are other programs with equally as difficult (or even easier) curriculum that can land you jobs with higher pay and greater chance of employment. Chem. E, Electrical E, Computer Science, Comp. E, general chemistry, etc. 

Don't like biochemistry that much? DON'T STUDY IT. That is my biggest piece of advice. Not only will you be miserable during the curriculum, but you probably won't get any job opportunities because you most likely won't put your all into looking for research, job opportunities, etc. I know this seems obvious, but it's important, and I've seen people on this board who are studying Biochem even though they don't like it.

**Third and final**: Don't lose hope. Keep hustling. If Biochemistry is your passion, keep pursuing it. You'll get what you want if you keep throwing yourself at it. Whether you're an undergrad, PhD, etc., you can reach your goals if you set them and keep working towards them. Don't give up!

I graduated in Biochemistry May 2017, however most, if not all, of the jobs I apply for either require or prefer a year's worth of laboratory experience. Even for Entry-Level Laboratory Technician positions in the Southeast US.

I know that I should have gotten this experience during my undergraduate program, but hindsight is 20/20 and at the time I was focused on my studies and getting the best academic experience I possibly can. I would love working in labs (hence why I apply for lab technician jobs), however I am at my wit's end. I know now that to move forward I will need that year of experience.

However, my biggest question is where can I find this experience as a Graduate? Internships seem limited to students around me, and I have not had much luck emailing professors at my university (Univeristy of South Carolina)

 I am literally offering to work at companies for nothing but the experience. I have also applied to many internships open to both alumni and students, as I want the lab experience.

I have done well in laboratory settings throughout my undergraduate studies, getting A's in most classes such as Physical Chemistry, Physical Biochemistry, Bacteriology, etc as well as the labs for both, but cannot seem to find internships or labs to work with to gain this experience. As I have said, I am not only passionate enough about the lab work to do it for the experience alone, but am also feeling as if I cannot advance career-wise without this experience.

So, finally the Tl;Dr-

Biochemistry,"Hello r/Biochemistry

I am a junior undergraduate chemistry/biochemistry student, I have taken general chemistry 1&amp;2, Organic Chemistry 1&amp;2, and now taking Inorganic chemistry at the University of Wisconsin Madison.

Biochemistry,"I am making a film where several groups of scientists disagree about the same results in a doping case. I've had several independent scientists weigh in (including UCLA's Don Catlin); however there is strength in numbers and I would love to get some more eyes on it. 

My question is this: Can you determine relative values of Recombinant EPO as compared to endogenous EPO by comparing the results of an SAR-PAGE and an IEF test? 

[Here is the athlete's PAGE result.](https://imgur.com/a/JgnkR)

Usually above the blue line represents the presence of recombinant (synthetic) EPO. The argument is that if there is any rEPO in this sample, it's not much, and it's certainly much less than his eEPO. 
[For example here is the sample compared to the positive control and two negative results from the same procedure.](https://imgur.com/a/TIyRK)  

Obviously it's certainly not a direct match, but that small shadow on Lane 15 could potentially be microdosing, which is what the athlete was accused of during his CAS hearing. 

[The problem becomes that his IEF test produces an overwhelmingly positive result, with the strongest bands undoubtably in the rEPO range.] (https://imgur.com/a/SESjN) The athlete's sample is Lane 2. Lane 1-Negative Control. Lane 3- Positive control. 

So the questions are:

* Does this look like the same sample being tested?
* Are these results inconsistent? If so, any explanation? 
* Is it normal for the intensity of those bands to be so different?
* If this was your lab, would you be satisfied with these results? (The IEF was not repeated, but the PAGE was). 
 
I can provide much more information if needed, but I don't want to be overwhelming. Here is the article that started the controversy:

So the overall reaction is exergonic and the overall free energy change is negative. Now prodcucts have less free energy than the reactants... I get the math I know how to calculate these things and how to resolve problems BUT what is happening in this system?

This leaves the photosynthetic portions of the cell useless. When this occurs, a Cyanophage can give a Cyanobacteria the protein it needs to kickstart it's photosynthetic functions again.

I have a question regarding DNA stability that pertains to forensic science. Let's suppose you are a forensic technician and are being asked to respond to a crime scene along an interstate freeway out in the Arizona boonies. It is usually ranging from 110-120 degrees normally around this time of day, and today is no exception. You reach the scene and after a few minutes are ready to begin dusting for prints. The car has been out there for about two hours. After you dust you realize that the entire car exterior has yielded no prints at all. Your partner suspects that they may have simply ""evaporated"". You test this by wiping some oil from your forehead onto your finger, placing your finger onto the car's hood, waiting 5 minutes, and dusting it. To your surprise you find that there is indeed no print to yield and you conclude that you cannot extract prints from this scene.

My professor faced a similar problem as a rookie in the field, and I began thinking about other methods of potentially extracting a print were I in his shoes. Apparently alternate light sources can determine the presence of DNA in a print, and shining a light under specific wavelengths can illuminate the DNA thereby revealing a print, but here is my question:

1) Under that kind of heat, without any moisture at all, with temperatures that can cook an egg, under hours of UV exposure, does DNA remain intact enough for alternate light sources to detect it?

http://www.jbc.org/content/274/45/32015.full.pdf

I'm looking at Figure 5, in which the authors vary substrate (UDP-GlcNAc) concentration to determine Km of the enzyme (they use two different mutants; the top graph is WT which exists as a trimer, the bottom is a partial deletion that is active but exists as a monomer). What I don't understand is why Km is varying so greatly. My understanding of Km is that it's the concentration of substrate at which the enzyme's rate of reaction is half of Vmax. So Km should be irrespective of substrate concentration, right? 

I'm not sure if the fact that the substrate they're varying is the donor (UDP-GlcNAc) and not the peptide that's accepting the modification makes a difference?

I found a handful and one in particular seems quite promising from the clone 29E.2A3 (https://bxcell.com/product/invivomab-anti-human-pd-l1-b7-h1/). However, where I am ordering from they never specify the epitope, where the antibody will interact with B7-H1.

I use 10% acrylamide in the running buffer I just described. This has worked fine before but the last time I ran my gel the loading dye (and sample lanes) were very distorted and some of the loading dye turned yellow mid gel.

 This happens periodically and usually my PI just shrugs and says do it over but I want to be able to tack down why this happens and avoid the cause in the first place so I can trust my results. 

 I know the color change means that that pH of my gel some how changed in the middle but I'm not sure what went wrong to make that happen. I pH'ed my Tris to pH 7.5 at RT but it should become more basic at 4 degrees (where I run my gel) not more acidic. I also am wondering if the APS is too old an that's whats caused the un-even pH of my gel.

 I make sure that the glass is totally dry and that there are no air bubbles when I pour the gel. 

The set up I use to pour my gel is really shitty and leaks 90% of the time so I've taken to putting a think layer of the gel mix (500uL) at the bottom with double the around of APS and TMED added to it so it polymerizes along the bottom extremely quickly there by creating a seal.

Biochemistry,"Hi, biochemists!

I am in a soil science graduate program, and part of my project is doing PLFA analysis. For those that may not know, PLFA in a nutshell is where you take the soil, extract the phospholipids in the microbes' cellular membranes, methylate the lipids to fatty acid methyl esters, and look for signature fatty acids using a GC to get an idea of overall community composition. Target range is chain lengths between 14 and 20C long.

My problem is this: the method that my lab has developed and that my supervisor wants me to follow doesn't use a surrogate standard. Since this method involves a lot of sample transfers and fractionation, I want to use a surrogate standard. Another PLFA method uses a 19:0/19:0 phospholipid as their surrogate, and I was going to, too. I ordered it, then found out our method uses the methylated 19:0 as an internal standard (to find GC error), meaning that I can't use it as a surrogate. Since this other method uses a methylated 10:0 as an internal standard, my idea was to just swap the two and use a 10:0/10:0 phospholipid surrogate. However, I'm concerned that it might not be close enough to the targeted C chain length to make a good surrogate standard.

So - what should I consider when selecting a surrogate standard? Should I find something with a longer chain to get closer to the target range, something like 12 or 13 C long?

I originally wanted to do protein engineering and this lab combined RNA biochemistry with protein engineering.

Biochemistry,"Hello,

I've recently begun thinking about the next stage in my career with the possibility of transitioning out of the laboratory. I've either worked as a lab tech or research associate in biopharma. I haven't quite figured out what I'd like to get into (data science, marketing analytics, or entrepreneurship) but it seems like the job market, in general, doesn't care about scientists that don't have PhDs. Almost every single online article or blog post that empowers scientists to transition out of the laboratory only ever speak to those with PhDs. I'm not really interested in getting a PhD since I'm getting married and may start a family soon, plus every PhD graduate I've talked to seems to have hated their experience.

Biochemistry,"Hey all. Undergrad peasant with a question for those in either industry or academia. I know you're probably sick of career posts by now but I do have a few direct questions I would appreciate input on. Up until this point I've been pretty dead set on med school (and still feel very driven toward med) but working in a research lab has piqued my curiosity for chem options. I know that both medicine and science require a significant amount of time, effort, and dedication, and actually really don't mind working long hours cause lab work is fun. I've found a lot of joy on the bench, but also recognize that I'm working in an extremely well organized lab with an excellent PI, and it's been made clear that this isn't the norm for most biochem jobs.

Here are my questions:

* Basically every post I have seen regarding biochemistry as a career choice says that it's super long hours for trash pay, and that you have to move to the middle of nowhere to make any good wages. Assuming one gets a Ph.D, what options do they have that provide for a good salary (100k)?

* What does the job market look like in Oregon?

* I would be particularly interested in some sort of pharmaceutical development/medicinal work (obviously not with patients unless I also got an MD, and am not interested in MD/Ph.D programs for a bunch of reasons). What does the job market look like for drug development/pharmaceuticals without an MD? Do you put yourself at a significant disadvantage if you only go Ph.D?

* Adding onto this, what would work actually look like on a daily basis for a Ph.D in a drug development setting? I know from doing research in academia (at only an undergrad level) that it's not exactly glamorous, but getting data feels so damn good and I love getting up to go do it every day. Is this similar in industry?

Also another bit of a tangent question - does it matter where you get your Ph.D or undergrad degree from? How much does it matter?

Biochemistry,"Would supplying a low-voltage electric current to the body via an external energy source, such as a battery, at a level that would not induce muscle contractions, have the potential to reduce free radicals in the body by reacting with and stabilizing reactive molecules in the body that are missing an electron?

Potential reasons this may work/be worth attempting:

- Most antioxidants work by donating electrons or preventing 
  oxidants from stealing electrons (supplying electrons would cut 
  out the middle-man).
- Free radicals are known to damage DNA and other cellular 
  components
- Minor electric shocks are relatively harmless.
- It would be awesome if something so simple could have a large 
  effect on preventing the effects of aging and help us recover 
  faster from things like exercise.

Potential reasons this may fail:

- The method of electron delivery may not deliver enough electrons 
  to the areas that need them most, such as areas with the highest 
  content of mitochondria, like the heart and brain.
- The concentration of electrons needed to have a significant effect 
  on reducing oxidation may be too high to supply through the skin 
  without inducing muscle contractions.
- Electrons are charged molecules, which may not be able to get 
  through the lipid bilayer of cells.
- The electrons may react with molecules which they shouldn‚Äôt 
  react with.
- Other unknowns

Possible implementations:

- Measure the voltage of cells in different tissues and biomarkers of 
  oxidative stress in the muscles of those tissues possibly by 
  glutathione levels and potentially C-reactive protein levels, as 
  inflammation is linked to oxidative stress, and create electrodes 
  that add electrons in an amount that improves these blood 
  biomarkers and has no side-effects.

Alternative routes to try:

- Take a electron carrier such as ubiquinone (oxidized Co-Q-10) 
  that is fat soluble, can cross the blood brain barrier, is able to 
  transfer electrons and participates in the electron transport chain 
  to have a more targeted approach to counteracting oxidation and 
  reach hard-to-target areas.

Potential arguments against:

- The body has evolved to handle oxidative stress through multiple 
  mechanisms, and the level of oxidation, as evidenced by the 
  levels of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione is usually 
  low suggesting that the cell is not damaged much by oxidation.
- The cell is fine tuned to a very specific electro-chemical 
  environment that doesn‚Äôt do well with too much tinkering. If 
  electrons are supplied to the cell they would interfere with ion 
  balance and contribute to an unbalanced intracellular 
  environment.
- Free radicals act as cell signalling molecules. A low concentration 
  is beneficial.
- If supplying electrons does reduce levels of free radicals 
  generated by things such as exercise, the hormetic benefits may 
  be negated, and no endogenous upregulation of antioxidant 
  defenses will occur.

I just finished an introductionary course in biochemistry and this question popped up on my exam. Exam is over now, but i couldn't find a satisfactionary answer from textbooks, notes from lectures or even the internet, so i would like to have some closure on this and satisfy my curiosity. Hoping someone here can give me some insight :) 


So the assumptions are:


*that glucose is the only avaible energy source


*Hexokinase for some reason does not work


*Oxygen is avaible and it is an aerobic cell (has mitochondria).


Then there were some statements that should be proven false or correct.


I)Pyruvate ferments into lactate to produce ATP --&gt; This one is false because fermentation is an anaerobic pathway, and we have access to O2 here.


II)The cell continue to produce energy through the electron-transport chain.


III)The cell loses its ability to produce ATP


IV)O2-consumption will increase


So, from what i understand hexokinase converts glucose into G6P which cannot exit the cell, and thus enables the cell to stock up on G6P, while glucose can diffundate into the cell, since the consentration of glucose inside is kept low. Also, the conversion is the first step of glycolysis. But can glycolysis work without that first step? As long as glycolysis works the cell can produce ATP through the electron-transport-chain, and that answers II and III. If O2-consumption increase/decrease i assume it is because of an increase/decrease of activity in krebs cycle/glycolysis, since oxidative phosphorylation in ETC consumes O2. but I don't know how to answer this question. If glycolysis works without hexokinase, I think the O2-consumption will decrease, since glucose diffundation into the cell will be slower due to the glucose-gradient inside not being kept low by hexokinase. Thus slowing glycolysis, krebs cycle and ETC.


Those are my thoughts, I would be very grateful if someone would clarify what is wrong/right about my assessments. Thank you :) ",[QUESTION] How does lack of hexokinase affect glycolysis?
Biochemistry,"Structurally, methamphetamine (""meth"") and amphetamine (I'm just gonna refer to it as ""adderall,"" which I know is an oversimplification) are very similar. Literally the only difference is that a proton is replaced by a methyl group. My question is: why does the body treat these two molecules differently? I want the full biochem response, don't feel you have to simplify anything. 

I know meth mimics dopamine and causes a release of dopamine (how?) but why doesn't adderall to the same degree?

Disclaimer: I know adderall isn't just amphetamine, and I realize I'm ignoring stereochemistry by calling methamphetamine and amphetamine unique molecules when in reality they have enantiomers. 

I keep finding oversimplifications online but I really want the chemistry behind it. Thank you!

Edit: I want to try to explain my exact point of confusion:
Meth resembles dopamine, which I understand. However, amphetamine resembles dopamine more, does it not? Dopamine is essentially amphetamine minus the methyl on the last carbon, plus the two OH groups on the benzene ring. But in meth, nitrogen has an entire methyl attached to it, so doesn't it look differently?

A possible explanation: the body looks for similar groups, not necessarily exact location, resulting in meth looking almost exactly like dopamine without the OHs. ",Methamphetamine vs amphetamine
Biochemistry,"I've been reading this book lately, namely 'Guns, Germs, and Steel' by Jared Diamond, and had some trouble reconciling my understanding of how immunity works with the logic described in the book. The book in question touches the matter of ancient Eurasian civilizations having to deal with a series of deadly epidemics, and the author states this as the reason why our immunity is so strong against such a palette of diseases, in contrast to the indigenous peoples of the Americas, for example. Thus he, the author, implies that immunity of our grandgrandgrandgrand.....grandgreatparents was somehow inherited in us, and that's where I have the little trouble understanding it. The book, of course, being written for an average reader, doesn't delve into the mechanism of how it works. As far as I'm concerned immunity against something has to be acquired through your lifetime, and that's the basic idea of the immune system - you'll only have to proliferate the lymphocytes necessary in your time and your place, and inheriting it from your parents is useless since its too much of a gamble. So you're born with immunoglobulins to every possible antigens out there and your organism selects the ones it needs according to the demands.

So how can people form some kind of hereditary immunity against, say, plague, to become germ transmitters and yet be unaffected by it altogether?

P.S. Even as I'm writing this I've come up with two ideas to this question, one involving mutations in the set of gene blocks that lymphocytes can use to shuffle while making their immunoglobulins, and the other through the means of changing one's biochemistry, making themselves ""invisible"" to the germ, like the sickle-cell disease allele against malaria. Still, I'd be glad to hear your thoughts and knowledge on the question. Thanks beforehand",Can immunity against germs be genetically inherited?
Biochemistry,"I hope this question makes sense. 

This particular protein of interest is a tetramer, made up of two dimers that dimerise in the centre. Mutations have been made to the central dimerisation interface to see if the protein binds to it's promoter as a dimer or a tetramer. So the mutations hope to break this dimer-dimer interface. If the protein still binds it binds a dimer, if the protein no longer binds it binds as a tetramer. 

To check if the mutations have actually broken the dimer-dimer interface would you run it on an SDS-PAGE (to check the mass against wild-type)? This would denature the proteins, and this is what is confusing me.

Biochemistry,"Hi all. 
I have a question about malic acid.

On the pubchem page for malic acid it says

Orally or ip administered l- or dl-malic acid was extensively eliminated as carbon dioxide (83 to 92%). No differences between the two forms were found in the rates (90 to 95% in 24 hr) or routes of excretion.

https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/malic_acid#section=Absorption-Distribution-and-Excretion

Correct me if I am wrong but-
If it is breathed out then that means it was absorbed from the intestines (when given orally), crossed cell membranes, made it into the mitochondria, entered krebs cycle, and was oxidised to CO2?

Biochemistry,"This ended up being a lot longer than I had anticipated. The TL;DR for my main question is: How bad is it to get your BS and your PhD from the same department?

To give you a little bit of context, I just finished my first year in the Biochemistry Master‚Äôs program at the university where I did my undergraduate work. My girlfriend and I graduated with our bachelor‚Äôs degrees at the same time. She had applied to medical school and been waitlisted. After a while we assumed that she did not get accepted and we decided to stay at our university to get Masters Degrees while we decided what to do next. At this point we had both been undergraduate researchers for several years and our PI was happy to let us stay. Over the summer she was notified by the medical school that she had been accepted. The university she had been accepted to is about 60 miles from my university. Although it meant that we would have to move apart, we decided that it would be best if she took the offer. I did not have any opportunities lined up at her new school and we decided that I would remain at my current school, finish the Master‚Äôs degree and apply to her school to finish my PhD. 


Under this plan, our hope was that I would finish my Master‚Äôs degree in two years (which means I would finish one year from now), transfer to her school to finish my PhD somewhere between four and six years after that. She would finish her MD in four years and remain an additional four years to do her residency. This would allow us to live in the same city again next year. However we are having doubts about how realistic this plan is. She is not sure how likely it is that she will be able to stay at her university to do her residency. Additionally, although I‚Äôd like to think that I have a strong application and I think it is likely that I would get accepted at her university if I applied, I can‚Äôt be certain that this is the case. But if either I don‚Äôt get accepted at her school for my PhD, or if I do get accepted but she is unable to remain there for her residency, we will have to move apart (probably father apart than we are currently living) while one or both of us finishes our training. That is a really worrying thought.


I recently had my first committee meeting, which is part of the reason we are starting the question the wisdom of the plan described above. My graduate committee offered to let me take my oral examinations a year early if I stayed to do my PhD here. I have been working in my current lab for quite some time now and given this familiarity, they seem optimistic that I would be able to finish my PhD three years from now. This would put me finishing my PhD at the same my girlfriend finished her MD. In this case we would be able to move on to new opportunities in three years, and we wouldn‚Äôt have to worry as much about where she does her residency. 


Although this seems like a really attractive option, there are a few caveats. Most obviously, it means that we would have to live apart for three more years rather than one more year. That will be hard on us, both as individuals and as a couple. Additionally, I‚Äôm not sure how much I can trust my committee to be objective when they say they think I‚Äôd be able to finish my PhD in the next three years. Our department has been having a really rough time with recruiting lately and we are really low on graduate students. It‚Äôs possible that they are telling me what they think will get me to stay, without really considering whether it‚Äôs a realistic offer.
Before I make any decisions, I would like to have a decent understanding of precisely how it will affect my career if I have my BS and my PhD from the same department. My PI has told me that she doesn‚Äôt think it will affect it in any meaningful way. While I can usually trust my PI, she seems pretty motivated to get me to stay, so I don‚Äôt think I can count on her to be entirely objective in this case. I would also like to understand how it will affect my girlfriend‚Äôs career if she does her MD and her residency at the same school.


Deciding which of these two options to take has been difficult for us, partly because we‚Äôre trying to make decisions based on factors that we don‚Äôt have much control over, and partly because it‚Äôs looking like we‚Äôll be eating a shit sandwich either way. My first priority is the long-term health of my current relationship. My inclination is to stay where I‚Äôm at to finish my PhD. For the alternative option to work, we both will have to get accepted into new programs at her school. I have no idea how likely that is, and I‚Äôm not very comfortable rolling those dice. Any insight anybody might have on the situation would be greatly appreciated.

Biochemistry,"Hello /r/Biochemistry!

I'm currently a first year university student who, after endless contemplation, is still confused about their future. I began school as a Food Science student, but due to distaste in the idea of some of the highly likely job prospects and 400-level courses in Food Science (Muscle and Dairy Foods, Food Processing, etc., seeing as I am a person who chooses not to eat animal products and believes in whole, plant-based nutrition), I first decided that I might like to major in Nutrition, under a  'Basic Sciences' option offered by my university. This was due to my intense desire to understand nutrition at the most fundamental level and perhaps do research regarding plant based diets and their efficacy. One of my lab professors, when discussing with him my interests, suggested Biochemistry as a major, and minoring in Nutrition instead.

Is it possible to have a career that is biochemically focused on nutrition? If I was interested in Public Health and/or Food Sciences as well, is there some sort of career that can fit all of these interests? The main thing I am concerned about with a degree in Biochemistry is that I will end up working in a research lab or something that ultimately has nothing to do with nutrition.

The main problem I have with majoring in Nutrition is the biased curriculum. I want to be able to understand the principles of nutrient absorption, metabolism, etc. and topics such as nutritional epidemiology without being taught how to open my own clinical practice or what diet is ""best for individuals."" I'm afraid that I'd be dissapointed and have to bite my tongue with a lot of what is taught. I feel that a more 'general' degree such as biochemistry might give me a really good foundation to build off of and make my own (educated) assumptions about human nutrition.

Biochemistry,"Hi,


I was looking at taking different supplements/nootropics for myself and had a question about the synthesis of Dopamine. It is well known that L-DOPA can cross the blood brain barrier where as Dopamine itself cannot, therefore in treatments where the patient is in need of Dopamine, they insert the precursor instead of Dopamine itself.


Anyways, I have been thinking of taking L-Tyrosine AA supplements for my body since I know that L-Tyrosine is a precursor in Dopamine biosynthesis and can be directly converted into L-DOPA by the enzyme AAAH (and in the blood Tyrosine Hydroxylase according to what I've read? Not sure...) I'm assuming that the AAAH enzyme is only present in brain cells. L-Tyrosine is unable to pass through the blood brain barrier because of it's structure, therefore will never be converted into L-DOPA in my brain, correct?


Therefore... is taking L-Tyrosine for my diet pointless if my goal is to stimulate the production of Dopamine? In addition to this, when I'm studying different Biochemical pathways and mechanisms, how should I figure out/know where all of the enzymes are? Are all the enzymes in the Dopamine synthesis pathway located exclusively in the brain? If so, how am I supposed to know this?


Thank you in advanced :) 

Edit:
After looking at more things online, I can see that there are several enzymes that stimulate the production of Tyrosine into L-DOPA. There's the AAAH enzyme for cells in the brain, and Tyrosine Hydroxylase in in the CNS? Can someone correct me on this?

I am currently generating a simulation for 2D ligand-receptor binding, and was wondering if anyone could help with the general concept of k_on and k_off rate constants, as I lack a biochemistry background.  I want to be able to input k_on and k_off to alter the ligand-receptor interactions.

From what I understand, k_on and k_off are proportional to these probabilities. Since k_on has units of 1/concentration*time, and k_off has units of 1/time, if I pre-define my concentration and time step (say 1 micro-molar of ligand concentration, and 1 micro-second time intervals), and I were to multiply k_on by the pre-defined concentration and time step, and multiply k_off by the pre-defined time step, would the result of that unit cancellation be the same as the probability of association and probability of dissociation between a single pair of ligand and receptor?",On-rate/off-rate for ligand binding simulation

Biochemistry,"Since methamphetamine produces dopamine (mainly in D3, and D4), as well as epinephrine (well, not really ""produce"" epinephrine as it meth gets metabolized into epinephrine), it will temporarily increase IQ (but also oxidizes dopamine receptors for 2 days (up to 2 weeks), preventing the vital brain ""organs"" (I would call them) such as the adenylyl cyclase (specifically AC in DA) from doing its job, which in turn will have reverse effects such as lower a persons IQ 12 hours after taking the drug). So why does it induce neurotoxicity?


 Why didn't human brains allow for more natural production for phenethylamine without inducing oxidation of DA terminals? I mean:


* It would raise a persons IQ without causing harm to the person
* There would be no way for a person to be depressed (people commit suicide due to depression, this should've been filtered by evolution, instead people have to rely on prescription drugs such as Prozac, and in extreme cases be prescribed Desoxyn (prescription version of meth) to save their lives.
* It would prevent people from dying from allergies such as peanut allergies by metabolizing into fairly high doses of epinephrine.
* It would empower a person to do something with their life instead of just being uneducated or unemployed.
* It would **prevent parkinsons disease** by preventing oxidation of DA terminals.
* ADHD wouldn't exist.
* Schitzophrenia wouldn't exist (fun fact: schizo is literally someone on a comedown of natural ""meth"" (phenethylamine) (I could be lying though - this is my hypothesis but I don't see how this cannot be true, as schizo is just an overproduction of dopamine and oxidation of dopamine receptors IN THE EXACT SAME DA (D3) as meth has its actions on, and has the same psychological effects and psychosis as a heavy meth user coming down from meth - hallucinations, feelings of ""bugs"" underneath skin, insomnia, and feeling ""unwanted"". I wasn't able to find any research papers confirming this and no studies on this have been done, but the only studies that have been done confirm the fact that schizo is an overproduction of dopamine, specifically in D3, which is the same DA in which meth stimulates dopamine)



Can someone explain why evolution decided to do this? Why didn't evolution make it so human brains produced tons of phenethylamine naturally? Why do human brains only produce 20cc of phenethylamine a day, equivalent to only 5mg of methamphetanine? Why are high doses of phenythylamine (or dopamine) neurotoxic? Evolution could've just made the brain use CO2 to prevent neurotoxicity from extremely high doses of meth. Meth is not that neurotoxic if taken with a MAO-B inhibitor (such as Seleganine, which strangely is really close to methamphetamine, and REALLY close to dextroamphetamine), why doesn't the human body inhibit MAO-B naturally, I mean the only point of MAO-B is to get rid of dopamine and serotonin, is it not???


Levomethamphetamine is sold OTC as a nasal decongestant in most drug stores, with the same effects as methamphetamine, besides psychological effects. Levomethamphetamine is also used to cure allergies. But PMA is mainly beneficial to the brain, with some *good* side effects, such as allergies and viruses. Levorotatory form of PMA is ineffective.


And while we're here, why do people die from allergies? such as peanut allergies. I mean I get the main reason for allergies - to get rid of toxic waste (like FJS is really close ARA A1 (peanuts)), but the point of allergies is not to cause death but prevent it. Why do allergies CAUSE death?


[Also, it intrigues me how meth is actually HEALTHY at low doses.](https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3A.gov+methampehtamine+low+dose&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS733US733&amp;oq=site%3A.gov+methampehtamine+low+dose&amp;aqs=chrome..69i57j69i58.4749j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8)


TL;DR: **Why didn't evolution force our brains to produce extremely high doses of phenethylamine naturally without being neurotoxic via oxidation of DA terminals?**

UPDATE: For those that didn't understand why I used ""meth"" as an example, is because its structurally really close to PMA and has the same psychological effects (methamphetamine chemical formula is phenethylamine+2 methyl groups), the difference is that the 2 methyl groups in meth perish the BBB, while if someone took PMA it wouldn't be able to penetrate the BBB, thus not causing any psychological effects. It MIGHT have slightly different effects then PMA, but those effects are not known, and in terms of neurotoxicity, it is the same as PMA (but if pure PMA was consumed, it would not be able to penetrate the BBB)

The processes that occur in the body are extremely fascinating to me, and I think I eventually want to go into genetics or something similar. However, when I took chemistry last year (non-AP), I found it boring. Bonding and electrons and stuff...it just doesn't do anything for me. Because of that, I'm worried that once I get past the more general explanations that AP Bio offers and get into the specifics, I'll actually hate what I currently find fascinating.

Biochemistry,"Say for example, you are wanting to produce nicotine, it is found in the tobacco plant. Why is the organic synthesis of nicotine used in commercial production for say vape oils rather than a method that involves using recombinant DNA to express the set of genes responsible in tobacco plants for the synthesis of nicotine then extracting/purifying the nicotine expressed in your host cell?

Is this because it is cheaper to use organic synthesis for such a large scale procedure? If so, then insulin production must be very very expensive?

Is it because the lifetime of these compounds such as nicotine would be very short in the cell or be toxic in the culture so no product would really be produced? Okay, maybe nicotine was a bad example because it is a toxin, but suppose you were wanting to synthesize a compound that wasn't toxic to the cell unless in an extremely high concentration. If the lifetime would be too short could you modify the synthesis pathway in some way to extend the lifetime, or would this be too complicated to be worthwhile?

Is it because it would be very difficult to extract/purify the compound? Could you not find/design some antibody to recognize specifically your compound so an immunological assay could be ran, or even just extract/purify by using organic chemistry?

Maybe I'm missing something fundamentally, but I don't understand why a method using recombinant DNA for expression &amp; purification couldn't/isn't used for synthesizing anything but protein.",Why is organic synthesis of compounds already found in organisms preferred over a method that is similar to that used for protein synth/purification by using recombinant DNA technology.

If I'm to run an antibody purification, that protein needs to be bound to the sepharose for antibodies to bind. 

However, in order for the antibody to unbind, a pH change also has to be induced. Why won't this process lead to proteins coming off the sepharose as well? Does the buffer (100 mM glycine pH 2.8 compared to L-glutathione + Tris-HCl pH 8.0) make a difference in why the protein doesn't also lose affinity?

Biochemistry,"Hello everyone, I am studying for an upcoming biochemistry exam and had a question regarding a practice exam question. The answers were given, but I am having a hard time with the reasoning behind it. 

The question: You prepare one liter of a 0.1M buffer solution, pH 6.15, from 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid (pK A 6.15, molecular weight 195.2) and a 1M standard solution of NaOH, by weighing out ____g of MESH, adding ____ml of NaOH solution, and making the volume up to one liter with water. The answers given were 19.5 g MESH and 50 mL NaOH.

I understand that for a buffer solution, the pH will be equal to the pKa given an equal amount of acid and base. These are not equal amounts however, which is where I am confused. 19.5 g is 0.1 mol of MESH, so 0.1 mol in 1 liter of water will make a 0.1 M solution. The explanation to the answer of the question says that 50 mL of 1M NaOH is 0.05 mol (this makes sense), but all combined wth 1 L of water, the solution consists of 0.05 M conjugate acid and 0.05 M conjugate base. Why isn't half of the amount of MESH added, and how does the 0.1 mol of MESH in a 0.1 M solution result in 0.05 M conjugate acid solution?

I feel I may be thinking too hard about this, but I am currently really at a loss as to how this result is obtained. Any help is greatly appreciated.

EDIT: OK I think I figured it out, but if someone can confirm or deny my reasoning that would be great. Is 0.1 mol of MESH added along with 0.05 mol of NaOH so that the full 0.05 mol of NaOH can react with half of the MESH to form the 0.05 mol of conjugate base? This would leave no NaOH, 0.05 mol of MESH, and 0.05 mol of MES-. Therefore the overall solution molarity would be 1M. It makes sense to me this way, though I am not 100% sure.

So I've learned cell death is reversible until calcium gets into the cell, which activates enzymes and then you're really screwed. I am very interested in coming up with theories for the potential reversibility of hypoxic death, and that's why I'm asking 

A: how long can highly active brain neurons go without oxygen before calcium gets in, and

B: once calcium DOES get in, how long do you have before it wreaks irreversible damage? (How long can you keep the hyperactive bull in the China shop?)",How long before hypoxia neurons let in calcium?

Biochemistry,"Today, I was trying to confirm ADP is reduced to ATP... but haven't found much to confirm this belief. Which makes me question whether it is normally considered a redox reaction.

Now I understand that NAD+ is reduced to NADH (This makes sense as the hydrogen carries electrons... plus, it is a common example). 

I also understand that the oxidation of glucose produce ATP/NADH... which means both of those molecules are being reduced (One thing oxidized, another thing reduced). 

But, when I look at the ATP/ADP reaction... I have questions. If I think about electrons being transferred, it makes sense. A phosphate group is carrying electrons and thus reducing ADP when added (producing ATP). And when a phosphate group is removed from ATP, electrons are removed, which is oxidation. 

But typically, additional bonds to oxygen mean... oxidation. And well, the phosphate group has a lot of oxygen on it (so ADP to ATP seems to be oxidation by that convention).

I'm probably over thinking this but was also curious since NADH is often used as an example for redox reaction but ADP/ATP isn't.

Biochemistry,"There are so many hormones/cytokines/neurotransmitters and receptors, all of which act through about 4-5 secondary messaging systems. So if one particular cell has receptors for say, 2 different hormones which act via the same secondary messenger, is there any way that the cell can differentiate the two stimuli? I'm guessing there must be some differentiation between the two, otherwise, wouldn't the effect of both the hormones be the same?

For example, in a hepatocyte, beta-adrenergic receptors and glucagon receptors both act via Gs-coupled receptors, downstream of which, cAMP is increased. Since the cAMP is the same, the changes it would make are also the same. So does it to the hepatocyte, make no difference if the primary messenger was an epinephrine or a glucagon?

I'm assuming the receptors would make a difference, but aren't the coupled G-proteins (Gs) also the same? Is there a difference of amplitude?

I'm a current undergraduate student studying Medical Technology and my thesis is about the possible effect of depolarizing cells with toxins against the binding of saxitoxin. While most of our methodologies are in place, my groupmates and I(mostly I and a friend) still do not have any way to measure if there are any significant effects of delaying the binding of saxitoxin against it ; the only way we are currently deciding on measuring it is through the following

* Na-K levels in blood
* Death time

Neither of which I am actually convinced to have a good representation of the effects of depolarization on saxitoxin poisoning. 

Finally, a thought came up to me recently and as a result, I am now looking for the end-product of saxitoxin-catabolism and see if we can use it as a way to measure the effects of depolarization inhibition.

Biochemistry,"I'm interested in genetically modifying some plants or other macroscopic organisms but the barriers are relatively high (Agrobacterium, tissue culture etc.). Obviously one of the key limitations is getting the DNA into the cell without killing the cell. Caulerpa is a genus of fast growing marine macro algae that is unique in that the large structure is a single multi nucleated cell. It is able to deferentially express genes to create unique anatomical structures like leaves, shoots, and roots.

It resembles kelp in that it has a waxy green exterior and a clear jelly interior. One thing I'm not sure of is if the nuclei are in the jelly or only in the thin exterior layer. Anyway my idea was that since this is a single cell maybe it could be transformed by injecting DNA directly into it.

There would be some issues with regards to the multiple nuclei, perhaps a GFP reporter could be added and expressing regions could be cloned?

Biochemistry,"Hey all, kind of new to this subreddit, but I think this is the best place to talk about my struggles with Biochemistry.

Background:
I go to a top university, transferred to here from a university that wasn't so ""prestigious"". My current university is actually top 5 in biochemistry for graduate school.

When I transferred here from my previous uni, I was very lost at first. The atmosphere at this university is very different from my previous one and the classes are definitely harder, almost to a fault. It didn't help that I came into this university with no friends at all and couldn't really make friends with my peers here as well. I personally hate the lecture-at-students + exam format and prefer classes with discussions to get much more engaged. However, upon coming here, my classes either had optional discussions or no discussion at all. I found that here, you're a lot more on your own, which honestly really sucked. Office hours for my biochem professors were never helpful too. I remember going to professor office hours for one of my biochem classes last semester, and I felt very belittled and that I was wasting his time.

Needless to say, the stress of changing schools and trying to keep up in the new, academically stressful environment have affected my grades and I have a 2.75 so far. It doesn't help that my classes that are C's are all classes that are my major classes.

Now this semester, I thought that I would do better, but have fallen behind yet again. I go to office hours for my physical chemistry course, but still barely score average (and scored very below average once) on tests and I'm very scared that I might not pass this course. My immunology course was also harder than expected, probably going to be leaving me with a C+ or B- in that course. My only A course this semester is a smaller biochemistry course that I'm taking with an amazing set biochemistry professors that I've gotten very close with. I've pretty much come to terms with myself that I will probably be getting below a 3.0 yet again this semester.

My question is, what do I do for the rest of my years here? I'm thinking about retaking classes to boost my GPA and I have been looking tirelessly for labs to work in so I can boost experience. I don't know what else to do and I feel like such a failure in biochemistry. I do want to go to grad school, hopefully UCSD, but that seems like such a hopeless dream now.",Struggling at top university

We're asked to analyze where and when a  hypothetical protein (called X) is expressed, and find its subcellular localization and determine the gene's epistasis in a pathway and the gene's role in the nervous system.

All we are given is that we can buy a UAS-X drosophila strain. Anything else we need we must make ourselves (weird).

So I'm thinking that I would have to find a GAL4 strain with expression in the relevant tissues (wing-imaginal discs). For detection, CRISPR/Cas9 to introduce GFP tags into the reporter gene. 

I figured that by using light-sheet microscopy, I could locate where the protein is expressed in the larvae, and even map its movement (maybe if I used SPED instead of standard light-sheet microscopy if I'm going to look at larval development over a full day period).

But for the subcellular localization, all I can think of is letting the larva overexpress the protein massively (maybe with a temp-controlled reporter gene like Shibire) and see where the proteins accumulate in the cells of the imaginal discs. 

Similarly, using temp. control to induce or shut off the gene expression, I could possibly do some sort of RNA-seq transcriptomics analysis and look at what genes are affected in this imaginary pathway and get an epistatic profile for the gene. 

I'm really not sure though since the question is quite vague and I'm not sure if any of this makes sense since it is all theoretical.

**Q1**: Where should I go so I can begin rigorously understanding the mathematical constraints, physical forces and limitations, thermodynamic forces and limitations, and the chemical/intermolecular interactions that are occurring in biological reactions? 

 i.e., progression of topics from foundations to conceptual integration to application, quality textbooks, accessible online courses, etc.?

I know that /r/biochemistry's wiki section provides a list of courses typically offered in university biochemistry program, and I'll be sure to enroll in them, but I want to explore these subjects outside of the classroom, and I'm not sure what resources would be best for my goals. 

Some examples of what I consider ""deeper conceptual understanding"" include: how to understand what forces are responsible for a chemical reaction, developing the intuition to understand what physical/chemical/etc. forces may be involved behind the mechanism of a reaction, why those chemical reactions are necessary for cellular/bodily function, if it's possible for the products of a chemical reaction to be formed in any other way or the intermediate steps of a chemical reaction to be successfully altered in any other way, what happens if certain steps are altered or skipped, etc.

I feel that this is the kind of ""big picture"" or ""integrative"" knowledge that allows somebody to not only comprehend the function of neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and hormones, but also develop new substances that can target specific locations.

-- --

**Q2**: After I've learned to grasp the various different factors affecting biochemical mechanisms, where can I go to begin understanding the factor present within the human body that affect absorption, transport, efficacy, excretion, etc., of active compounds? I.e., crossing the blood-brain barrier, crossing the intestines, excretion via the kidneys or the liver, etc.

-- --

**Q3**: Finally, I have somewhat unrelated question: what is the difference between biochemistry and chemical biology?

Biochemistry,"I used to have an old model kit where you could connect pieces in numerous ways. Every piece... irregardless of what it represented... had 6 connection points. For instance, you could make a Fischer projection of D-glucose and have every carbon directly above/below each other. Of course, if you wanted to show D-glucosepyranose... you would need to undo and re-do many of those connections. But it worked very well for representing different models. 

Unfortunately, the new model kid I purchases isn't as accommodating... which makes it very difficult to create Fischer projects. Now, having the bonds at particular places may technically be more realistic, but i find it more obnoxious to deal with. Not to mention, all the oxygen bonds have both bonds next to each other, so you can make double bonds. But if you aren't making double bonds... it's just obnoxious.

In wild-type ACVR1, the side chain of positively-charged Arg206 stabilizes the Œ±-helix formed by ACVR1 amino acids 198-206. The Arg206His mutation results in the loss of interaction between the Œ±-helix and Arg206, destabilizing the protein.

I'm worried that if I decide to major in Physio and take a bunch of Ecology classes I won't have the proper education to do work at Bio companies, or that a masters would be harder since I'm not taking classes like pChem in undergrad and I'd have to play catch up.

Biochemistry,"I was asked about my career, and seeing as we get a lot of career questions, I thought I would post the response. Feel free to ask questions, however, I'm not terribly familiar with Reddit

My Response:


First, let me welcome you to the wide world outside academia. Many students have similar academic ambitions to you because that‚Äôs the environment that they feel most familiar with; I certainly did during undergrad. PhD doesn‚Äôt mean only academia. Most of the senior managers/directors at my biotech company have their PhDs. 



Staying within science, there‚Äôs a few career tracks. R&amp;D (Feasibility, Verification/Validation studies, Analytical studies, etc.) With a BS, you‚Äôll be a pair of hands for a few years and move into a lab/research management position. MS gets you hired faster to the same types of work, but there‚Äôs still the career glass ceiling without the PhD. Acquired skills aren‚Äôt easily transferred between companies. 



QA/QC requires a strong background in science, a lot of work, and more repetition. However you can move up faster. I‚Äôm mid-30s years old and my BS/MS colleagues in R&amp;D are capped out at high level technician. In QC/QA they‚Äôre Scientist/Manager and have interesting side-projects in addition to their boring day-to-day. In manufacturing, it‚Äôs similar to QA/QC. There are exceptions, but this is seems to be the trend. 


If you don‚Äôt go for the PhD, I would strongly recommend the MS. After graduation, you will need a few years of experience before you transfer to a business role. Many go into $ale$ (sales) for the money, or marketing, technical training/customer relations (if you like working with people), Clinical Trial management, or some other role in the company. Every biotech needs government approval = Regulatory Affairs. If hospital or university employees are having a problem with an instrument, they need to talk to a tech support rep who knows science. Those PhDs are called Field Application Scientists. Even the regular Tech Support reps have BS/MS degrees. 



MANY PhDs get jobs outside the lab because there‚Äôs a glut in the market. My company has hired some of the most prestigious PhDs I‚Äôve ever met. They start at ~$60k/yr. In Marketing or Scientific Affairs (PhDs who run studies in conjunction with research labs that support products) they start much higher and reach double that in a few years. However, the private sector job market is much less secure than academia and good people get laid off if their projects don‚Äôt pan out. 



The best PhDs have a sharp focus and a narrow interest. Personally, I have a variety of interests so I sought out a job that relies on many skills; project management. In business school, you take the same core classes everywhere, and then I focused on new product development and project management. I am personally responsible for scheduling, budgeting, planning, executing plans, for a project team. R&amp;D, Operations, Marketing, Regulatory Affairs, Engineering, etc. all are on my team and we develop products for the market. It‚Äôs a desk job but it relies very heavily on my years in R&amp;D. Also, it‚Äôs a team, meaning that while I am the project leader, I am nobody‚Äôs boss. I can‚Äôt fire anyone and people can say ‚Äúno‚Äù when I ask them to do something. Find and watch the show Better Off Ted (it's on Netflix). In your career, you can find a position that uses as much or as little science as you want. Your undergrad degree gains you access to a sector of the economy. Pursue a variety of opportunities and see where you enjoy working. 



I come from humble origins, which means that in my 30s, I‚Äôve had some sort of regular employment for 28 years (newspapers, lawn care, babysitting, grocery store, construction, waiting tables, computer tech, then my career). The best jobs, I‚Äôve loved 1/3 of the time, hated 1/4 of the time, and been pretty meh about the rest. Stick with it and keep a record of your accomplishments. 



Regarding the MBA, any worthwhile MBA program is 2 years long and requires several years of experience. (don‚Äôt ever forget that every university operates like a business and is selling you something; not every product/degree is of equal value). You want your management education right before you need to start managing people. You learn mostly the same things at any accredited business school, but people will listen to (or trust) the Stanford-MBA rather than the local-school-MBA. Think of top 30 business schools if not top 10.  


From a practical standpoint, imagine if you‚Äôre 40-something years old with 20 years of experience and some 25 year old BS/MBA kid is hired to a management position. How well would you take that? That work group is not going to function very well.  Educated, western professionals can handle lots of types of diversity (racial, ethnic, religious, male/female) but we struggle with age diversity. I get a lot of sarcasm and anger from older employees whose careers have stalled. 



The day-to-day of working for a company is a lot like high school, except everyone has mortgages and is actually trying to get pregnant. It‚Äôs more like high school than like college. There are reasons for that, but that‚Äôs for another discussion. You will find pettiness, short-sightedness, and self-interest everywhere. Use courage and kindness to rise above it. Focus on why you do what you do, work hard, and manage up as well as down. There‚Äôs happy in every day, it‚Äôs up to you to find it.

It was a very strong odor, and I could ""feel"" it in my lungs. It wasnt really a full breath, exposure was maybe 1 second. Prior to this there was a small spill, the bottle got cleaned but i noticed some traces on the outside were still there.
I'm not coughing or in pain or anything, but it just feels different, and im not sure if thats just placebo. Is a small amount of this a real health risk? How much would I have to inhale for it to be dangerous? And how soon would I notice if there is something wrong?",Danger of inhaling small amount of Temed

Biochemistry,"I'm always asked to do this in biochem courses, yet they also teach us that you never know until you actually create the mutation. 

Say it is a T138S surface mutation for the fbpA major ferric iron-binding protein in Haemophilus influenzae. I would assume it will not change the function of the protein, seeing as how it's a surface mutation and does not change the active site of the protein, thus not changing its iron-binding properties. Also threonine to serine would be a conservative mutation, considering they are quite similar  and differing only by the placement of the hydroxyl group.

Biochemistry,"Greetings everyone. I am currently undergoing my masters' experimental phase, which envolves testing my peptide called Phylloseptin-P1 (uniprot.org/uniprot/P86710), with concentration ranging from 100 to 3,12¬µg/mL, against various pathogenic microorganisms (E. coli, S. aureus, L. infantum, L. amazonensis, P. falciparum and S. mansoni), along with two cell strains called J774 and HepG2. Most of the tests to be done by spectrofotometry methods.

While doing some preliminary tests with E. coli and S. aureus using the agar weel diffusion method, I solubilized my peptide (previously lyophilizated) in water and PBS 1x (separately), both to no effect, even in the highest concentration. Following an advice by my professor, I added 0,1% of DMSO to the PBS solution, and voil√†! My peptide was active in the concentrations of 100 and 50¬µg/mL.

So here comes my question: why is it dissolving my peptide in DMSO so significant for the result? By common sense I heard that my peptide, being an amphipathic molecule, would create a micelle in the presence of water and so the DMSO acts disrupting this micelle, thus releasing the molecules from each other and making sure that they would stay active.

But I really need some reliable source to clarify this assumption. Would anyone have a link or paper that could help me?",Why dissolving peptides in DMSO?

I have a pretty good GPA (3.5), I have two years worth of research experience in a genetics lab with no grad students and I'm the main person who is apart of every project. I was able to get a summer intership at TSRI over the summer. I feel as if I'm a pretty good candidate for some top grad schools, but when I was at the intership this past summer I honestly saw how grad school is going to go, with long hours and things not always working, and it gave me a taste of what kind of grind grad school will be.
So since getting back I've had some doubt about grad school right away and have been thinking about some kind of alternative for a year or two instead of going straight once out of my bachelor's. I guess what is getting to me is that I think I'll be ready for grad school, but I'm not sure if I want to start the grind immediately. So are there even jobs for just a person with just a B.S. in Biochemistry? From my 20 minute search online, it seems like the area I live in (Buffalo) doesn't have much, much less anything for a person with just a B.S., and not a M.S. or Ph.D. I just feel a little trapped right now because it seems like everything you need a M.S. or Ph.D., but Idk if I want to go to grad school right now or not.

1. Prepare enzyme solution

Biochemistry,"Hey there gang,

I was doing a size exclusion chromatography experiment with my protein and mutant of the same protein with a 30 residue deletion.  I wanted to see how the addition of a peptide changes how and where the protein elutes from the column by running each protein with and without a FITC-labeled peptide and track the position of the protein and peptide by measuring the A280 and A490.

The mutant protein worked great, without the peptide I got a lovely peak in the A280 and nothing in the A490.  With the peptide the A280 peak and the A490 peak aligned perfectly, showing nice binding.

The wild-type protein yielded some confusing results.  Without the FITC-peptide I got the expected A280 peak, but also a small but considerable A490 peak, which sorta confounds my results.

So my question is, what might be causing my protein to absorb at 490nm (its not at all related to any fluorescent protein, and I've more or less ruled out any contamination), but the deletion of just 30 amino acids in the mutant does not?

Biochemistry,"My professor says that fructose is not a reducing sugar. Is this right? Several biochem books say it is, but I wonder if I'm missing something.",Fructose - Reducing sugar?
Biochemistry,"I think I understand how disaccharides are formed: the OH of the anomeric carbon of the reducing monomer attacking the hydrogen of the anomeric carbon of another monomer in a dehydration reaction. So for sucrose: anomer C1 of glucose and anomer C2 of fructose linking together to produce a 1,2 glycosidic bond. 

But what about maltose? It is 2 glucose molecules linked together. The reducing anomer will be C1 and the oxidizing carbon is C4. Why C4? C4 is not the anomeric carbon and there is nothing special about it. Would there be glucose molecules that are link at 1,5  1,3  1,2  etc.? They obviously would not be maltoses but do these linkages exist for the same reason why 1,4 linkage exist?",Maltose - glycosidic bond formation

Biochemistry,"Hi r/Biochemistry: I am looking for advice from those of you in research. 

I am a first time research student completing my summer research program, which culminates in a poster presentation summarizing what I have completed. My project (assigned by my prof) was to investigate the possible liquid-liquid phase separation properties of a prion protein domain, yet despite trying all summer I was not able to replicate the LLPS behaviour of that protein in solution that was *once observed years before* (not published work, no written record, no follow-ups by the person who initially made it and is no longer with our lab). My project did not have much in the way of foundational work done prior in the lab by others, so most of my time was spent on tweaking the purification protocol, eliminating contamination problems, constructing vectors etc. In addition, we realized that we could not easily conduct quantification of the protein solution characteristics; I was only able to make viscous protein solutions (nothing interesting like LLPS, or opalescence...then maybe we could've measured light scattering in response to varying concentrations or pH's), but we don't have a viscometer and wasn't able to afford one. In short... I have absolutely nothing in the way of numerical data. Not even qualitative data could have been recorded (save videos/pictures taken by cell-phone cameras and a ton of SDSPAGE gel images) as the lab microscope camera was broken - and even then we did not see physical forms of protein aggregate or fibrils or anything in my viscous protein solutions, via a fluorescent-label study with the light-microscope. I have no visual information to show, none, nada.

At any rate, my prof is very nonchalant about the outcome of my project, and in his words ""I don't mind if you go and present a bad poster"" but he has gone on vacation abroad now and until my poster session has passed. I haven't received any advice on what content to put, he hasn't been replying to my E-mails. :| I cannot avoid my fate at the poster session like he can. Our department held a poster workshop for us: the main point was that more figures and less text is desirable, but what could constitute a passing second-tier poster for my slightly dysfunctional project besides walls of text? I can only drone on about background information, the troubles we ran in to in terms of groundwork and how that was overcame, and future directions... but if I must state the ""conclusion"" to our non-quantitative experiments so far - is that my particular protein doesn't do anything cool like LLPS in solution, and that the original observation was probably due to unknown contamination and not an intrinsic behaviour of the purified protein. Should things like that get presented at poster sessions?

Biochemistry,"Here's the anecdote, but I want you to keep in mind that I am unwilling to accept placebo as a sufficient answer.  If we do successfully crowd source an answer, fucking publish that shit as a memo in whatever journal you want if you want to.  

.

My wife is unable to produce enough breastmilk for our newborn son and we have begun supplementing what little she can produce with donated breastmilk from folks in the region.  Seeing as how she is still passing remnants of what we are told is an unusually thick amniotic sac, we are hoping that we can build a bridge out of donor milk until hers comes in.

.

Here's the thing though, everyfuckingbody is on medications.  So we are playing this game of maximize your B.S. in biology and those C+s in organic chem 10 years ago aren't serving me as well as when my biggest challenge was counting tritium in well samples.  

.

So we have a donor who has a month worth frozen milk and is on rabeprazole and 25mg of zoloft.  We are willing to take the risk on that dosage of zoloft, especially seeing as how we can dilute it further with other donor milk.  But our breastmilk donor is having severe issues with her infant, and rather than change her proton pump medication, she cut apart her diet into component parts.  She found that her infant's symptoms disappeared when she cut dairy from her diet.  

.

**Why did that work?**

...

Let's not assume that it's placebo.  We can speculate how cutting commercially available dairy in the US that was in the mother's diet may have mood stabilizing effects or some such, but I'd like any speculation like that to be supported non-anecdotally.  

...

To tackle this we need to know a shortlist of molecules from bovine dairy that are passed in the breastmilk.  Then we need to look at how they may interact with the [rabeprazole chemical structure](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/image/imgsrv.fcgi?cid=14720269&amp;t=l).  What interactions that lead to a messed up unhappy baby can you see with magic chemistry eyes that I can't with my marine-biology eyes?  

...

But let's assume that the above project is fruitless.  Let's talk about what we can do to the milk or some dietary additives that we can take to modulate the rabeprazole transferred in the breastmilk to our son.  When I compare the above chemical structure for rabeprazole to [omeprazole's,](http://images.rxlist.com/images/rxlist/omepra2.gif) I'm seeing a sodium vs. magnesium on the ring structure near the double bonded oxygen and then a super polar oxygen on the tail end of the rabeprazole.  

.

Considering that sodium is there, can't i add a little bit of water to the donated milk and then flash pasteurize to degrade the molecule?

.

Or, do I hold onto the milk until my son is about six months and simply always pair the milk with a temporally close feeding of an acidic juice?

The most abundant type of fatty acid in butter is oleic acid (18:1 cis-delta9). A single serving size of butter has been defined as one tablespoon, or 14 grams. From one serving of butter, how many ATP molecules are derived from the complete beta-oxidation of oleic acid (molecular weight = 282.5 g/mol).

I found that complete beta oxidation of oleic acid gives 8 NADH (2.5 ATP), 9 acetyl CoA (10 ATP), and 7 FADH2 (1.5 ATP), totaling 120.5 ATP. Subtract 2 ATP for activation, we end up with 118 ATP. Now back to the question, do I find the ATP molecules from 14 grams of butter? ",Help with a question?

Biochemistry,"I'm an incoming freshman as a chemical engineering student in Canada. My long-term objective is to pursue an academic career in biochemical research, and I intend to go to grad school.

I understand that by majoring in ChemE, I'll miss out on laboratory classes and a substantial theory. I also understand chemical engineering has little chemistry involved (barely any biochemistry especially).

However, I currently volunteer as a research student for a biochemistry lab at my university and have paid experience (I initially secured the placement via cold-emailing after self-studying theory and lab techniques in my high school's lab under supervision). I plan to continue working with the lab in undergrad, and I likely could find further research opportunities through this connection.

I'm mostly interested in ChemE because I'd like to bring a unique engineering perspective (one with a deep background in math, physics, and design) to my studies and have access to more industry opportunities in undergrad (again to bring a unique perspective to academic research).

To what extent would lab experience be an acceptable substitute for lab classes? Would this undergrad in chemical engineering be a viable path to studying biochemistry academically, or, from your perspective, would you recommend switching majors to biochemistry?

I understand if you might not have direct experience this, but any opinions or advice would help immensely. Thank you so much.

**Update:** For anyone who comes across this post in the future, here's a list of the pros and cons of majoring in ChemE with the intent of pursuing a career in academic biochemistry research (as curated from the amazingly helpful commenters on this post, along with advice I gathered from people outside of Reddit):

Pros:

* Lets one develop an interdisciplinary skillset to bring to the field of biochemistry
* More opportunities to work in the industry (important if I want to work straight out of undergrad, but research seems to be a better use of time if I plan to stay in academia and go to grad school)
* It's more employable straight out of undergrad (which isn't much of a pro for me as I'm planning to go to grad school)

Cons:

* One would miss out on substantial theoretical groundwork (especially Biochem 1 &amp; 2 + years 2-4 of biology)
* One would also miss out on laboratory classes, which would likely teach more techniques to greater depth than one would accumulate working at different research positions
* Harder to both maintain a high GPA and have time to make substantial research contributions as an undergrad

In the end, I've decided to switch majors to Biophysics (with a subspecialization in biochemistry offered by my university). This would let me develop a more thorough background in biochemical theory and lab techniques, while leaving the door open to engineering in the future.

3. then it must get to where it is supposed to be effective.. the dermis, the epidermis.. I'm not sure...

4. If it does absorb where it is supposed to, is it still effective there?

The only answer I can think of, is that it's not the [long] DNA that mutates, rather a plasmid itself mutates and transfers. But if that's the case, how did the first plasmid arise? I'm not sure I'm making a lot of sense, but I can't find much help on Google. I tried askscience but didn't get an answer. Thanks!

Point A reads, ""Oppositely charged groups lower the Pka [of the alpha carboxyl group] by stabilizing the zwitter ion.""


I understand this.  When a carboxyl group is close to an amino group, the negative and positive charges of the two functional groups stabilize each other, thus favoring the deprotanated state of the carboxyl group, thus lowering it's Pka.


It seems to me that this stabilization is reciprocal.  The ionic state of the amino group is also stabilized, which is it's protonated state, which means the pKa of the amino group would be increased in this situation.  Therefore, one would predict that as you put a greater physical distance between the alpha carboxyl group and the alpha amino group, the pKa of the carboxyl group should increase and that of the amino group should decrease.  Indeed, the data given for [problem #7](http://imgur.com/zoPJedN) in the back of the chapter supports this idea.


Now here's my problem.  [Point B of figure 3-11](http://imgur.com/imYlQ2V), seems to contradict my understanding of how a carboxyl group changes the pKa of an amino group.  And it seems to contradict the data presented for problem #7 in the book.

I ask this because, well frankly I am tired of working service industry jobs, I graduated with a B.S. in Biochemistry in 2011. Right, I know, not a great time to graduate from the University in regards to the job market. And to make matters more difficult I relocated states out of my immediate school network back to my home state. Ended up in construction, which was not at all what I wanted, it was a family reference and put me to work quick... working outside in extreme environments doing field work was not what I had intended going to a expensive university for. When that fell apart, I ended up in the service industry, you know to pay student loans and cover living expenses... and now five years later, I cannot find a way out. I need to put a stop to it, I need a way out.

The reason I purposed the title question of this discussion was to gain insight on potential places I could look into applying for work, or career prospects of others with a similar background. I am tired of working nights and weekends, I mean I am not opposed to it since a man has got to eat but I would prefer to no longer work those shifts every week of my life. I am at my wits end. 

I figured with a Bachelors degree maybe I could get into entry level IT work or lab technician work or office administrative work or business/data analyst work; but between pre-requisite licensing and relevant work history/experience requirements; I have come up short of landing any meaningful interviews the entire time since graduating. Mostly, I feel defeated for having attended such an expensive private university for such a academic, difficult non lucrative major. I blame myself for these shortcomings and failures, but also poor advising, and lack of foresight. 

The only companies that ever call up for interviews are life insurance/MLM type companies and that line of work does not suite/interest me. I like working in labs, I enjoy working with my hands, and I like doing technical work. Working for no base salary contract sales commission only insurance jobs is not my idea of earning income for a career.

Is it really that simple? Is the linked detergent an acceptable chemical formulation to create injectable deoxycholic acid? 

*If a 75% solution of dmso was applied to the skin then a deoxycholic acid solution was applied (in an amount consistent with the proper dosage of 2mg/cm^2, such as max of 10ml to an area of skin 50 square cm), would the deoxycholic acid be carried across the skin to subcutaneous tissues like fat? Would the dmso react with the deoxycholic acid and create different chemicals on the skin or in the body? 

*I am aware that deoxycholic acid can be destructive to all kinds of cells.

How does grad degree industry life compare to PhD industry life? (not PhD academia life). How does it compare in salary, freedom in ideation, stress levels, stability, ability to move up in the company, demand?

Biochemistry,"Hello,

I have a review coming up at work, and would really like to discuss some options. I currently work at a niche biotechnology company, fortunate to have landed the job but am pretty unsatisfied due to the pay. I started as an intern doing standard laboratory technician work, now I'm a full time R&amp;D laboratory technician. 

I'll try to explain this without going into too much detail, but for the first year I essentially just assisted with experiments. My boss eventually ended up getting a promotion, leaving me to take over his work. Now I am in charge of experimental design, analysis, and scaling up process improvements to production for a particular product we make. I am coming up on two years of industry experience and am wondering what I am worth. All of my coworkers who have similar responsibilities make 2-3x more, however they all have various engineering degrees. Is it realistic to find a middle ground between my current salary of ~$17 an hour and that? 

Since taking over his position, I feel like I have done pretty well. I compiled metrics for the upcoming review and found that I have increased the amount of experiments run on my platform by 30%, and reduced turnaround time by 20% (all with less help since I am now doing his job and my old one).  Additionally, I've developed valuable IP, a process improvement that solves an industry wide problem (still scaling that one up though).  

So I feel stuck, it doesn't seem to be possible to get promoted at my current company due to my lack of education, but I know that I could never get hired somewhere else with more pay for the same reason. I would pursue a master's degree, but I really didn't give my education the respect it deserves during my undergrad, ending up with a pitiful 2.9 GPA. Which I believe is too low to get accepted into any programs. What options are available to me? 

Thanks, hopefully this was the right place to post this.

- Ketamine is a high trapping antagonist, meaning that it has a slow off rate.It has a trapping rate of 86 percent and this phenomena has been termed as a trapping block.

To me there was something very romantic about sipping coffee at 3 AM looking up protein structures. But now I'm not sure.

But what kinds of other career options are there (and salaries...professors tend to be very vague about that)? All I know are grad school to go into research and med school to, uh, be a doctor?

Biochemistry,"Hello everyone,

Long time lurker and first time poster. 

I completed my M.Sc. in Biochemistry about a year ago and was working as technician at an academic lab for just over a year. My projects focused on molecular cloning, protein purification, and characterization. A few months ago, I started my first job in an biotechnology research company as a Research associate. I have really enjoyed it and have always loved science. It's incredibly interesting to me to come to work with a new puzzle to solve. However, I'm fully aware that to grow in any STEM field is to continue to grow and learn new skills. I know that my abilities to pipette and run Westerns won't take me into a managerial or high levels. 

So I come to you guys looking for some advice on how I should diversify. I plan to work at my current company for the next few years but in the future I see three possibilites;

1. Is to return to academia and do a PhD. My current company doesn't have any joint programs so I would likely have to quit and I don't think it would be beneficial to lose 5 years of industrial experience for another academic position. 

2. I've started to learn Python using www.codecademy.com/ and think that it could be really important in the future. Bioinformatics appears to be a field that is exploding over the next several years and I could start to balance myself in both places. Is Python the right choice or would you guys suggest a different choice?

3. Is to (or in the somewhat near future) pursue an MBA using online classes. I would be able to continue working but would be able to continue to build my CV. I know that there a lot of free courses offered online and would likely start there. Does anyone have any recommendations on this end? I won't have the money to pay for another degree for a few years, but this could be a more expensive option.

Don't get me wrong, I love what I do. I just see the industry moving towards more computational work and know that I will hit a glass ceiling at some point without something that makes me more unique.

Thanks for reading and I look forward to hearing your advice.

Biochemistry,"I am in my first year of my Dentistry studies and Biochemistry is one of the more difficult classes here because every class is going too fast and the professors are lecturing everything so rapidly that I cannot comprehend the material as well as I should and I have too little time to manage all my subjects. The terminology is difficult because I can't get the meaning behind most of the names and etymology means a lot to me because I can absorb the material much easier. I have a problem imagining all the reactions and pathways because it all seems too abstract and easy to forget. I have about a month left until my biochem exam comes up and a month after that my metabolism exam takes place. I have to learn all about aminoacids,peptides,proteins,heteromacromolecules,lipids,vitamins,hormones and there are about 400 pages to learn. I am worried that I might not catch up and I'm a bit scared. Flashcards don't work for me. Do you have any useful websites you would like to share or some general tips to learn efficiently?

Biochemistry,"I deal in bio informatics and have next to zero bio chemistry, but my principal investigator is possibly expecting some database work on the Epi-Transcriptome and RNA methylations.

Biochemistry,"Good afternoon,

I was studying SSRI and MAOI effects on the body. I've learned the basic function of each. However, I can not understand the dosages.

Take a RIMA (Reversible Inhibitor of Monoamine Oxidase) MAOI medication such as **Caroxazone** (It namesake for argument's sake).

Hypothetically 10mg will prevent 100% of MAO enzymes from forming and being able to break down serotonin for 5-10. 

If a person were to take 5mg, would this reduce the effectiveness from 100% to 50%, however keep the 5-10?

Or would this reduce the time to (2.5-5 Hours) and still 100% effective against the production of enzymes.

Biochemistry,"I am unclear on precisely why proton leak, specifically as caused by uncoupling proteins, makes heat. I keep reading very general things like, ""ATP production is decreased, energy is dissipated in the form of heat""

But why? I don't see what the presence of H+ in larger amounts in the matrix, and less ATP production, would make heat. Wouldn't decreased ATP actually mean less energy for the cell is being made? I'd expect that to be cooler. Like when your CPU is idling, it's cooler, but when it's running a video game it gets hotter and consumes more energy.

Here's what I do know:

Normally, H+ goes through ATP Synthase to turn the rotor, which drives ATP production, and then H+ accumulates in the matrix. However, uncoupling proteins can allow H+ to go straight to the matrix, bypassing ATP Synthase, and hence the rotor to make ATP is not turned and ATP is not made.

If inhibited, are chemicals less able to exit the body, and instead build up, causing toxicity? If induced, what is the 'bad', if that is supposed to help chemicals exit the body faster?

Biochemistry,"I am interested in creating a game which more-accurately portrays bacteria growth, mutation, and evolution. I am a layman and I have done some small ammount of surface research. There will still be some simplification, and that's why I'd like help from this community.

The basic format of the game is most similar to a match-3 game, but instead of matching three of the same symbols, the player will break and form bonds to create carbohydrate chains. At first, the goal will be to grow in size and split to increase your culture's population. A large enough population will create random mutations. 

Choosing to play with a mutated cell starts the population from 0, but with luck, it will take less time to grow as the mutation (potentially) makes things easier. Mutations include alleles which express structures like flagella, cilia, pili, and fimbrae as well as organelles like chloroplasts. Some alleles will give your cell photosensitivity or a way to smell or taste the suspension fluid so you can seek a more favorable concentration of ""food"". One of the random mutations adds an allele to your gene chain, and the endgame involves selectively breeding the optimal bacteria. 

It's a matter of play style whether that means a slow, solid, plant-like cell that gets bonding energy more or less for free, a mobile amoeba that can pull other cells apart, or a parasitic cell that conjugates with other cells to pass on its gene chain. Older cultures are saved by their gene chain, a string of characters, and remain a presence in your game, leeching resources from the suspension fluid. These cultures can also be passed from friend to friend, in case you want to set up some level of symbiosis.

So far, I can get my head around creating lipid chains/sugars to store bond energy, and creating a phospholipid to increase the size of the cell. I've narrowed down the types of symbols to H (blue water), C (black earth), O (green air), N (red fire), S (yellow sun), P (white moon), and Fe (grey metal), but I have no idea what to build with them.

a) A protein that aggregates that can cause light scattering

b) A protein that binds a fluorophore, potentially quenching it

The wording he used kind of implied that ATP Synthase is present in ALL organisms. Is there any legitimacy to this?

2) Most ATP is being used for biosynthesis of organic molecules. (This is from my textbook). If so, that means we are making millions of structural bonds per second... What exactly are we making at such a rate? Mind you, this is one cell (of a human being's 40 trillion). What is each and every cell in your body making so quickly? ... 

Does this mean that entropy is degrading us that quickly? In that case why do dead things not instantly decay?      

Or is your cell just making that much extra stuff? And in that case, what the hell is it making?

Biochemistry," So here is a problem I got to solve :

The output of an experiment was given: 2 dilution series or checkerboard patterns of  the sandwich Elisa. The columns contain the dilution series of an antigen (Toxine A) and the rows contain the dilution of Antibody. Mark for both tabels (?) the ideal concentration of antibody (primary?), Calculate this concentration if you begin from a start concentration of 100 ¬µg/ml and a 2-fold dilution was executed. Both tabels are the result of an experiment using a different kind of concentration of the second antibody. 
Choose one of the two concentrations of the second antibody, which would give the most useful output. Which of the concentrations of antigen of the chosen table would you use to set up the standard curve. Calculate those concentrations. Further you have signals of 5 patients, negative controle and standard deviation. Make a conclusion whether the patients have toxine A in their blood. What would you do in case of doubt.

I don't have the tables of the checkerboard titration of Sandwich Elisa , but I used a table of a direct Elisa. And I executed this problem  on those results.The table and the worked out solution can be found here: 
http://imgur.com/a/24Tjv
The colums are diluted  with Antigen from 1 to 11(column 12 has no antigen), the rows are diluted with antibody (row H has no antibody).


Can someone explain clearly what the point is of a checkerboard titration and how to interpret the results ?  My guess is to set up  the optimal concentration of the reagents. For direct elisa: an optimal concentration of your antibody,an optimal concentration of antigen(what does that mean?, dilution of antigens that you can use to set up a standard curve at optimal concentration of your antibody). 

So you set up different antigen solutions, incubate them, let them attach to the wells, and wash away the unattached antigens. Afterwards you execute Elisa with the optimal concentration of the antibody. You measure their absorbance and setup  a standard curve.

The optimal concentrations of antibody  are rows D and E (but why?). I used  antibody concentration  at row D.
So concentration antibody of A is 100 ¬µg/ml, B is  50 ¬µg/ml,C is 25 ¬µg/ml, D is 12.5 ¬µg/ml.

Therefore I use optimal concentration antibody 12.5  ¬µg/ml with the absorbance of the diluted antigen concentration
1.8 1.8. 1.7 1.8 1.5 1.2 1.0 0.7 0.5 0.3 0.2 0.1
Which points can I use for setting up the standard curve ( all points or a certain set of points, is that the meaning of optimised antigen concentration)? The 4 first values has the same absorbance, so therefore I used the measurements of column 4 to column 12. Which would give a linear relation,and ideal to set up the standard curve.
In the previous stated problem  there was no given antigen concentration . So I assumed antigen concentration at column 1 was X ¬µg/ml, column 2  X/2 ¬µg/ml, X/4 ¬µg/ml.

Next is determining the antigen concentrations of the patients. If the absorbance signal of the patient. is above cutoff= negative control absorbance+3 standard deviation. I assumed for patient 1 and 2 that they were above the cut off (so you have to calculate their antigen concentration). Patient 3 was below the cut-off (no calculation needed). Patient 4 was uncertain: What should I do in that case?

Can we also assume that the absorbance signals of the patients were executed with the optimal concentration  antibody 12.5 ¬µg/ml.

Some notes and the TL;DR version:  
-I have a PI and we both want to move forward with my work  
-we both gave statements to the administration but they were largely ignored, they are still trying to dismiss me regardless of my status joining a lab  
-the main reason for dismissal is that they think I would be better off somewhere else  
-despite any problems with curriculum I have received stellar reviews in all my rotations and support from my PI, I love research or I would even consider staying    
-I am trying to decide if it is worth fighting to stay in the program to do my research when the administration seems largely apathetic about finding a proper solution. i.e. We have all been told that your PI has the final say on your fate and that classes dont matter much, but my chairs/advisers seem more interested in blaming admissions and washing their hands than trying to find a good way for me to stay in the graduate school  

I know we have all fretted or joked about this at some point during a PhD, but after my first year, it looks like I may actually get asked to leave.  
I joined a biomedical program straight after getting my undergrad degree in chemistry. The first year curriculum was rigorous, covered a huge range, and is best described as under repair. I found a lab, but since I only flat out passed one of the 4 main core courses we have (I was points away in another) both me and the administration are questioning if its a good idea for me to go through remediation.  
Some of the courses are changing and I really like the lab I joined even though it is technically in another department. However, I dont really see things getting better as far as curriculum goes. Still whatever I have to repeat wont be completely new to me this time. No one is really advocating for me to stay in the program bc they think my training and interests are not the best fit, but I have already spearheaded a few projects my PI and collaborators are really interested in and they are kindof relying on me to continue pushing forward. Should I fight to stay in a difficult program that is not actively providing the tools i need to get up to speed in their curriculum?  
I like the research environment and the lab I joined, but I hate the curriculum (OK everyone hates our curriculum) and the faculty are very research oriented so no one is really into teaching or organizing classes. I think I could be pretty employable with computational / quantitative skills but I am settled into NYC with my SO and am worried about quality-of-life in this competetive market without student housing and healthcare.  
Has anyone left a program in a similar way? what is pay grade and lifestyle/research difference going from being a PhD student to being a tech? Should I try to apply to programs again and is it going to be difficult to go back into a more physical or computational science field after wandering off into this cluster-fuck biochem/cell biology program?  
Sorry for the long/rambly post. It has been a rough year obviously and I am freaking out bc I dont know if I will be able to stay with the grad school or my lab and am not sure I will be happy if i can convince them to keep me in this particular program anyway. I did my best to save money while here, but when I balance the books with student loans going into repayment and a bit of personal debt I picked up while making the move, I have basically lost money since going to gradschool. i feel like I went for my dream by going after a PhD and was greeted by a bunch of bullshit and now im left displaced and potentially broke with disenfranchisement on top of it all.

Biochemistry,"Hello all, (forgive the TLDR)

I'm headed into junior year Biochemistry here at a Canadian Uni (UWO). I'm enrolled in a 'pre-med'(BMSc instead of BSc) type program but its essentially a BSc. 

I've realized a BSc is essentially worthless without some extra graduate or other type of study. I am keen on gaining some working experience for a few years after my studies and than beginning a venture into the world of Biotech or BioEng. I also enjoy Business management, leadership and Sales and Marketing.

In my third year I have a volunteer research position for a course as well as will be applying for a 16 month internship program.

I'd like to get some of your thoughts on Job Prospects/Overall quality of the following options I'm considering currently adding to my degree:

#1. BMSc and HBA
I'm fortunate to be attending UWO which has the well known (in Canada) Richard Ivey School of Business. This business school is known for its exclusive recruiting with many banks giving me the fallback option to pure business. Through this path I can receive a double degree in Biochem and Business for an extra two years. One issue is tuition is pricey @ 40k for the extra HBA degree. 

I estimate this option will likely take 7-8 yrs TOTAL.

#2. BMSc --&gt; MESc
Second option i'm considering is Graduate education in Biomedical ENG. I've always been adequately capable at math and physics. However, I was frightened of the work load of engineering when applying to uni and mistakenly chose not to go into it. I only have two math and one statistics courses under my belt during undergrad, but many Canadian universities will still accept me with only a BSc. I've also been considering venturing to Boston or San Fran colleges to add some biotech value to this option as well.

I estimate this option with take 6.5-7.5 yrs.

#3. BSc --&gt; MSc or Mbiotech
Last option I'm considering is either getting a Masters in Biochem to assist my qualifications in non-associate R&amp;D for Big Pharma and Biotech or getting a M Biotech (such as San Fran U's PSM in Biotech) to increase my chances of breaking into the industry. 

I estimate this option will take 7-8.5 Yrs.


I love the idea of being able to design products via an Engineering degree but also find the world of Biotech, Genetic Modifications and Synthetic biology fascinating, exciting and full of opportunity. 

Eventually I hope to reach an executive position (if I do not start my own venture) as business leadership, people, management and presentations seem to be natural talents of mine. I hope to use Science and/or engineering as mainly the vessel to reach an top position - but don't get me wrong I do love science and biochem :). 

Finally, I just want to mention that I've managed to do fairly well my first two years (AVG ~3.9 GPA) and am not afraid of the time commitment or difficulty of any of these options - they are all going to be quite challenging but I realize that it will just be part of course.

Biochemistry,"I was reading about someone being drugged while traveling abroad, and started looking for ways to counteract ketamine in a way similar to how Naloxone counteracts opiate overdoses. Ketamine is generally the drug-of-choice for spiking beverages, although scopolamine is also known to be used in South America.

Ketamine is known to act as a non-competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors, which produces most of the effects. It should be possible to eliminate or reduce the effects of ketamine by introducing another non-competitive antagonist, by preventing it from binding to NMDARs in the first place. I don't have a very well-rounded understanding of how these antagonists would interact, but it's my understanding that since ketamine is non-competitive, it cannot be removed from the receptor. Agonists would be totally useless for this reason. However, before it can interact with NMDARs, other molecules may be able to get there first and prevent any action at all, or at least delay it. Ironically, among these molecules are DXM, PCP, MXE, and Nitrous Oxide, all of which are used as recreational drugs.

Another possibility is that NMDAR action can be blocked entirely with dopamine, fostered by the introduction of amphetamines. At that point, any action on blocked NMDARs by ketamine is irrelevant.

The practical upshot of this is that potential victims of date rape or theft that believe they have been drugged could carry around something like an epi-pen to counteract the effects, and at the very least keep their wits about them.

I personally have had an experience where I believe I was almost drugged. I was offered a drink, and after several minutes the man who made it came back and handed it to me. I took one sip, and immediately felt apprehensive about accepting the drink. Several minutes later I was fairly certain the drink was spiked, because my head suddenly felt very, very light, and I was daydreaming in a more vivid fashion than I'm used to. Thankfully, I managed to remove myself from the situation before anything serious happened, but the experience has stuck with me ever since. I'm lucky, in the sense that I have experimented with drugs in the past enough to know what the onset feels like, but for most people, they're completely unaware of what to watch out for. I believe this approach could potentially save lives, and even if it saves one life, that makes this wall of text worth it.

- Extract the aqueous solution from B (C)

- Acidify C with H2SO4 to pH 1 (a change of colour occurs from brown to yellow) let's call this ""D""

- Add ethyl acetate to D, extract the organic phase. Finally in this organic phase are the hydrazone! and we can run it on TLC!

You have 10 sequences of dsDNA (A through J) which are arranged in an n-mer in any order and multiplicity (so more than one count of a given sequence). You know what the individual sequences are, but you don't know how they are arranged and how many of each there are. Without using DNA sequencing techniques, how do you determine the order and count of the sequences comprising the whole oligo? You are told that the first and last sequence will always be A and J. 

What I was thinking was: I'm not sure how knowing the first and last sequence will help me, since any method I employ has to be able to detect A and J multiples that might be interwoven in the middle among the other cassettes. I wanted at first to use restriction enzymes and sequential digests with electrophoresis to determine roughly the order and count of each, but it's clunky and I'm sure there is a more elegant way. I'm not sure how well antibodies would work since it would be hard to get all of them to be of similar avidity.

Biochemistry,"So I read somewhere in a textbook that ""the V0 or initial velocity is used in the steady state derivation of the Michaelis-Menten equation when the product concentration is negligible"". However, the V0 value of a reaction is calculated using the slope of product concentration vs time curve. I guess I am just confused with the language, because if you neglect product concentration, how can you use product concentration vs time curve to calculate V0 (inital velocity)? Imagine in an experimental scenario, you don't know the k constant of the reaction and you want to know the relationship between substrate concentration and rate of reaction. You have to calculate the inital rate of reaction or velocity somehow. If you neglect product concentration, how can the values of velocity be obtained? After all, we realized that rate of reaction is product formed divided by time before we realized that substrate concentration is related to velocity via rate constant.

Biochemistry,"Our lab has polyclonal antibodies from two separate companies for the same protein.

Uniprot defines only one isoform at 130 kDa, so the 100 kDa antibody seems weird. 

I know that PTMs such as proteolysis or phosphorylation can lead to multiple bands using the same antibody if each form contains the required epitope. However, I think this would cause at least one of our polyclonals to detect both the 100 kDa and 130 kDa bands. In the case of proteolysis, I feel like the polyclonal for the product (smaller, 100 kDa protein), should also recognize the larger 130 kDa precursor, but in our Western the 100 kDa-listed antibody only detects that one band.

Is it possible that the 100 kDa band is an unknown alternative splicing isoform with unique linear epitopes recognized only by polyclonal A? To me this seems unlikely due to the antibodies being polyclonal, and I'd expect an alternative splicing isoforms to share some linear epitope homology.

I'm a Biochemistry major in my third year (out of five), working for my undergraduate degree. I am trying to decide whether to keep my undergraduate degree a Biochemistry BS (Bachelor of Science) or change to a BA (Bachelor of Arts) because the BS requires me to take calculus 3, which I DO NOT want to take. I love all of my biochemistry courses, but I am just not a calculus person, and overall a Biochemistry BA is minimally different from a Biochemistry BS.

I am interested in pharmacology, so if I were to go to graduate school, it would be for my PhD in Pharmacology. However, my GPA is a little too low to be accepted into graduate school (though I do still have 2 years to pull that up), and it is a huge time and money commitment, so I am not 100% sure I want to go to graduate school.

I did meet with the dean of the graduate pharmacology school, and he told me that they would have no issue with my undergraduate degree being a BA, and that they do not care about me having taken calculus.

However, since I'm not sure I want to go to graduate school, I was considering trying to work in the industry first to see if I could get a decent and satisfying job with just my undergraduate degree.

Biochemistry,"I'm not sure of the mechanism of action. The carboxyl groups will be solvated by the by the water. However I've read several resources on it and have taken it as 

(a) water molecules will bind to the sulfates with a greater binding affinity than that of the carboxyl side chain groups. That causes a decrease in water molecules avaliable to bind to the side chains. The protein -protein interaction strength increases until, eventually, the protein - protein interactions are stronger then the protein - water interactions, which cause the proteins to bind to each other, while excluding water. Then the proteins are collected in a pellet by centrifugation.

or (b) The carboxylate groups on the side chains are more attracted to the sulfate ions, thus the water molecules  are kicked off from the side chains and replaced with the sulfates. Once enough water molecules have been kicked off, a gap is created between the water and the exterior side chains of the protein, thus freeing the proteins to be collected by centrifugation.

 Since water is in gross excess, I'm a bit skeptical about there being enough sulfates to to bind to enough water molecules, to the point where the proteins are more attracted to themselves than the water, but then again, .603 g/mL is a pretty high concentration of salt.

For example, in [this article](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/fetchObject.action?uri=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002111&amp;representation=PDF), right at the beginning of Results, it talks about Pdx1^tTA/+ ;tetO-H2B-GFP embryos. However, the article didn't define what tTA or tetO meant, nor do I understand what it means for tTA/+ to be in superscript. I know that it's probably referring to a genotype, but what does it mean for a transcription factor to have a genotype? I understand H2B is probably a histone protein and GFP is for visualizing, but I deduced that from my background knowledge. 

What is the best way to tackle unknown terms like these? (It would also be nice if someone could explain this specific problem) It's not reasonable for me to post on biology-forums or on reddit for every single term I don't recognize. I am looking for a way that I could help myself read these research papers. I only have a month left until the MCAT (finished with content review, but want to brush up on reading papers). Thanks. I appreciate any help I could get.

Biochemistry,"Hey Biochemists,

I recently got some rather interesting/confusing results.  My protein of interest has been known for quite some time to contain a Zinc Finger DNA binding domain.  My research has found compelling evidence that the DNA binding of my protein can actually be attributed to a different domain, and the supposed ZnF domain might actually be something else and serve a different function (I don't want to give too many details in fear of being scooped).  This new domain would actually have 2 zinc ions, while a ZnF only contains one.

To characterize the domains identity further, I submitted my protein to elemental analysis by ICP-OES spectrometry.  If my hypothesis is correct I should see a 2:1 (Zinc:Protein) molar ratio, however if it is indeed a ZnF is would only expect to see 1:1.

The results I got were 40uM Zinc (as determined by ICP-OES) and 10uM protein (as determined by A280 on a Nanodrop), a 4:1 ratio! Twice what I was expecting.  I am fairly sure that the zinc in the sample must be associated with the protein, and not left over from my purification protocol since I took meticulous steps to desalt and dialyze out any unbound zinc, and at no point in the prep did the zinc concentration go above 10uM.

Naturally, I am trying to find and test other explanations for my results.  The spectrometry is super precise and the error was very very low.  This leads me to believe that my calculation of the protein concentration might be wrong.  

Do any of you know if zinc ions binding to a protein would cause a significant change in the extinction coefficient, that might account for a two fold decrease in its apparent concentration?  Any other ideas about what might be going on would also be appreciated.

Regards,

S_A

I think there is a way to make a sensor that detects if a single antibody has caught something from the flow. So I'm trying to figure out if this would be a useful sensor, but this depends on how specific the antibodies really are.

When I ask biologists ""How specific are antibodies?"", they reply: ""Very-very specific"", but provide no values that I understand on microscopic level. But I am trying to make a quantitative estimation, e.g. for the following thought experiment:

Suppose I have attached an antibody to inorganic surface. It's an antibody for catching object **X**. And I flow blood over the surface, slowly. Suppose there's no **X** in this blood at all. But there are lots (maybe 10^17, or some crazy number like that) of other stray particles flowing by this antibody every second, right? So, when one of these non-target particles bumps into this one antibody, what is the probability that it would stick to this antibody despite being not specific to this antibody? Is it really 10^-17 ? Is it really so small?

And, in any case, how do I estimate this probability at least to 1-2 orders of magnitude?

This question is *not* about Kd (dissociation constant). Kd is about probability of false-negative binding ‚Äî antigen is present, but antibody doesn't bind it despite being specific to it. 
What I'm asking is the probability of a false-positive binding ‚Äî a probability that *non-target* particle will bind to this antibody ‚Äî a particle that is *not* the antigen this antibody is specific for.

They define the likelihood of a reactant Ci of proceeding to the next step, Ci+1 as Kp/(Kp+K-1). Intuitively, this makes some sense - Kp is the number of forward events per unit time, K-1 is the number of revers events, so the quantity they define comes to (forward events per unit time)/(total events per unit time) or the probability of a forward event. On board with that. They say however that the last step is different - here the equivalent constant is simply Kp/K-1. Couple of things to note - I do understand that the first constant is under a steady state assumption, and I realise that must break down for the last step since the final component doesn't go anywhere.

Genotyping was performed on DNA specimens from 1141 study participants in the NIH-funded Silent Infarct Transfusion (SIT) trial. We used the clinical and laboratory data to create separate endothelial dysfunction, vaso-occlusive severity scores and phenotype variables. Seventy-nine Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNP) in the VDR gene and three associated genes‚ÄîCYP27B1, VD binding protein, retinoid X receptor, were evaluated. The discovery cohort individuals had VDR haplotype information from a prior Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS).

The pheno-type data were obtained from the demographic and clinical information of the participants, and were used to create the severity scores, vaso-occlusive score, endothelial dysfunction severity, and overall severity score. Potential gene-gene interactions were analyzed for prediction of disease severity within each severity score. Two SNPs were associated with the overall severity score, 3 SNPs with the endothelial dysfunction severity score and 4 SNPs with the vaso-occlusive severity score. After permutation testing to correct for multiple comparisons, only one of the associations remained significant. SNP rs7965281 was found to be associated with the endothelial dysfunction severity score and remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons using permutation testing.

Biochemistry,"Hello,

I recently (yesterday) got to know that I have an enzyme deficiency. I'm not interested in any medical advice but I am interested in the enzyme's mechanism of action and I'm wondering if you could help me understand how it actually works.

So, the enzyme that apparently doesn't work properly for me is Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase and as far as I understand (correct me if I'm wrong) it's involved in reducing one form of Methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-MTHF) to another (5-MTHF) in order to turn Homocystein into Methionine to avoid high levels of Homocystein in the body. Is that correct and what other important functions does the enzyme have (direct and/or indirect)?

I also know that the enzyme defect is associated with vitamin B12 and folate deficiency even if getting the vitamins through the diet, but I don't really understand how. I know that vitamin B12 is needed in the process of turning Homocystein into Methionine and that folate is needed for nucleotide synthesis but I'm not sure how B12 and folate are associated with MTHFR.

Could someone please explain this to me?

Biochemistry,"Hi.

Let me walk you through this. I have 1g of glucose, total 5.5mmol, then go through glycolysis. Glycolysis produces 2 N and 2 ATP net. so each of these by this point are 11mmol. Remembering how after the aldolase reaction, it doubles every metabolite right? ok so 11mmol of pyruvate is formed as well.

now pyruvate (11mmol)  turns to acetylCOA (11mmol) and 2 N is also produced. By this point now there is 11mmol of ATP made and 22mmol of NADH made.

NOW!!!! FAT BIOSYNTHESIS! hoorah
palmitate has 16 carbons, acetylCoA has 2. so there will be in total 8 acetylCoAs that will make up palmitate. My bank has 11mmol of acetylCoAs to begin with.

The very first acetylCoA through malCoA synthetase makes a malonyl-CoA! and ATP is required to do this. but the rest of the acetylCoAs (so the other 7) enter at the ketoAcid synthase step which is right after malonyl-CoA is produced. 

Mini recap then: because only 1/8th of the 11mmol bank of acetylCoA makes malonyl coA, **only 1/8th of 11mmol of ATP is USED**. (correct me if im wrong). **How much malonyl-CoA is made? 1/8th of 11mmol right?** (correct me if im wrong).

The other 7/8th of 11mmol acetylCoA enter during ketoacid synthase. ketoacid synthase starts elongating this chain, and by this point as you know NADPH is used twice to get to the final fat form. 

so if 1/8th of 11mmol of malonyl CoA adds on the rest of 7/8th of 11mmol of the remaining acetylCoA that comes in at Ketoacid synthase, then that must mean **7/8th of 11mmol of NADPH is used right?** and because NADPH is used up twice to form the fat, it would just be doubled 2 x (7/8*11mmol). (correct if wrong).

Going back to how much fat was made...
it took 8 acetylCoAs to make palmitate, with an original bank of 11mmol of acetylCoA. doesn't this mean that 11mmol of fat was made in the end because 7/8 of 11mmol + 1/8 of 11mmol = 11mmol? (correct me if I'm wrong).

Biochemistry,"Some friends and I are experimentally trying to make [kumis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kumis), which is fermented alcoholic milk. I'm interested in the chemistry behind this process, so I've done some research, and find myself a bit confused.

I think I understand the basics of ethanol fermentation. Monosachharides undergo glycolysis, turning into pyruvic acid. As long as the environment is anaerobic, then the pyruvic acid gets converted into either ethanol or lactic acid (+ byproducts), depending on who is doing the converting.

Now, milk sugars are all lactose. Lactose is not by itself fermentable into alcohol, so this process is chemically a bit more complex. This is often done by mixing both lactobacilli and yeast into the milk. I've gathered that the lactobacilli can ferment the lactose by using lactase to first cleave it into glucose and galactose. The glucose gets on the glycolysis party train, and the galactose goes for a little joy ride before also getting on the glycolysis party train. The lactobacilli produce lactic acid, not ethanol, and so this is *homolactic fermentation*.

But kumis is made through *heterolactic fermentation*, which results in both ethanol and lactic acid. At some point here the yeast must get access to glucose or something it can work with, but unless the lactobacilli barf up glucose they just spent good hard energy on making, I don't see how.

So, what am I missing here? How are yeast used in the heterolactic fermentation process in milk, and where do they get their food? Are there other bacteria that can digest lactose but produce ethanol?

Biochemistry,"I'm doing a maleimide-sulfhydryl linkage reaction between deposited maleimide-conjugated DOPE lipid and my protein (H-Ras) which has one or two exposed C's depending on which construct I want to use. 

It is (of course) not working. I'd like ideas and opinions on the specificity of maleimide to sulfhydryls under my specific conditions, if anyone here has done something similar. I know that maleimides can react with primary amines at higher pH's.

I've tried (so far) 74/25/1 mole percent DOPE/DOPS/MCC-DOPE (MCC is the maleimide lipid) and 97/2/1 DOPC/DOPS/MCC-DOPE. The proteins are taken out of reducing agent for about 1 hour before exposed to deposited lipids, but non-reducing gels show that they form homo-dimers at a fairly low rate.

I am a freshman majoring in biochemistry/biophysics (this is a single major). I came into my university with an obscene amount of AP credit so if I just take the required courses I will have a very small course load in these coming years. 

Because of this I have thought about the possibility of double majoring but am not sure what I want to double major in yet. I am set on going into research and pursuing a Phd in the future.

Biochemistry,"I know this might get me crucified here, but, I wanted your opinion guys :)

tl;dr: I have a nearly complete degree in molecular biology &amp; biochemistry.  Originally went into psychology (I'm a moron), then realized a) psych is useless for making a living, and b) I liked neuroscience aspects, and thought to do medicine.  I could probably get in to med school in the US (not in Canada where I'm at), but with how much it'll cost, I'll never be able to pay it off even on a doctor's salary.

On the other hand, I've been dealt a really good hand in IT.  Started off doing part-time work at an information security firm.  Picked up some good experience in networking and a few certs along the way (CCNA + MCSA in Server 2012 if anyone cares; can also get RHCSA next time I drive over to Seattle).  Starting a job as a network administrator next week, and steamrolling everything so far.

While my salary is on the lower range right now, it's more from the location I live in than anything else.  I realistically don't see myself being able to make a living doing biochemistry - virtually everyone I know from school that hasn't gone to med/pharmacy is either doing masters, minimum-wage ""internships"" in hopes of landing an FT position, or most commonly, retail and Starbucks.  Only two people doing their grad school I realistically see as having a career in biochem, and they're 10 times more motivated and have better work ethic than me.

In IT, no-one gives a damn about your degree.  Hell, I'd have $60k less in loans and be making $30k/year more if I went straight into IT than university.  My CCNA basically landed me my current job, MCSA the job I'm about to start.

I'm working on a paper review, and I realized that I keep getting stuck on the same concept. I keep reading over and over that phosphatidylinositol is located on the INNER (cytoplasmic) leaflet of the cell membrane only. Seems easy enough to understand. But when I read about GPI anchored proteins, I see that they are anchored OUTSIDE the cell.

I understand that the location of these proteins has to do with how they are synthesized in the lumen of the ER, and when the released vesicles fuse with the cell membrane, the proteins end up on the outside. That makes sense to me. What doesn't make sense is that I thought PI was only located on the inner leaflet. Does GPI not count? Is it still located on the inner leaflet and the proteins are anchored to their tails or something?

Biochemistry,"My equation in its simplest form replaces the non-competitive, competitive, mixed non-competitive, uncompetitive, partial non-competitive, partial competitive, partial mixed non-competitive etc. and also allows the description of activators as well.
Simply by recognizing the distinction between the binding constant any (ki value) and the actually affect it has on the enzyme parameters all of these equations can be represented with one that relates change in enzymatic characteristics to the mass action binding of modifiers to enzymes.
So for the MM equation that means changes in Km and Vmax can simply be equated to

Km-(delta km X [M]/([M]+Kx))

and

Vmax-(delta Vmax X [M]/([M]+Kx))

where modifier concentration is used rather than inhibitor as there is a potential you may have an activator rather than an inhibitor

[M] is modifier concentration

Kx is the binding coefficient

Once the distinction is made and equations are not tied to the idea that the binding constant produces the inhibition, which is what the competitive non-competitive, mixed non-competitive equations rely on, it is a simple matter to expand this equation to describe complex kinetics which would take months of derivations, or long hours trying to figure out texts like Segels book on enzyme kinetics. This also helps advance the idea that all enzymes inhibitor interactions follow the same kinetic principles governing the interactions of all molecules and their interactions with enzymes can be described quite simply.

You theorize that the observed mutation is linked to where within the genome your  plasmid inserted.

I have a cell line that expresses a version of firefly luciferase with a mutation that causes it to be aberrantly spliced (pLuc705).

I work in a chemistry lab that is just now branching out to biological projects, and hence our equipment is a little limited (I had to borrow various components to assemble a single, functional agarose gel setup). My group is trying to demonstrate a platinum catalyst-mediated reaction in the presence of an antibody (any antibody as proof of concept, later a medically relevant one) and essentially just need a relatively easy/convenient system to show this.

Our first thought was a dye-conjugated antibody like what is commonly sold for confocal microscopy (ie FITC-anti-biotin, for instance), but we're still unsure of how to verify and quantify that the antibodies are still functional after our platinum reaction.

In your experience, what would be the easiest way to do this? An SPR chip in a Biacore with anti-biotin on a biotinylated plate would be great, but would is way too expensive. If need be, we thought about incubating cells in FITC-antibody of a robust protein (say, actin) and just proving it with FACS or a quantitative Western, if we can find the equipment to do it. Thought I'd ask you all for ideas you might have.

I am currently studying the binding kinetics of my protein of interest to various lengths of dsDNA.  I am trying to bind 5'-Biotinylated DNA to a Streptavidin BIAcore chip.  Two of my dsDNA fragments (20bp and 50bp) bind just fine.  They were made by purchasing 5'-biotinylated commercial oligonucleotides and annealing them with their complementary strand.

The third strand is considerably bigger at 250bp.  It was made by means of PCR with a 5'-biotinylated forward primer and a regular reverse primer.  The PCR product is then run out on a gel and extracted with a gel extraction kit.  When I run the product over the chip, I see no increase in response units, which suggests that it is not binding properly.

I have several theories as to what might be going on, but could use some additional input.

1) The 250bp fragment is very long and is therefore unable to diffuse into the dextran surface of the chip and bind to the streptavidin.  I have considered using a smaller fragment to mitigate this as an issue.

2) The biotin on the primers is somehow getting removed during the PCR or gel extraction step.  This is my first time dealing with biotinylated primers so I have no idea whether this is a possible issue.

Biochemistry,"**Short version:** Hi! I was wondering if anyone had suggestions for a cheap protein standard other BSA or HSA. I thought IgG would be reasonably cheap, because it's commonly used in Bradford assays, but it's sold in milligram quantities on Sigma. 

**Longer version:** I'm trying to quantify the nmol of carbonyls per microgram protein on a gel using the fluorescein-5-thiosemicarbazide (FTC) system developed by Chaudhuri et al [1]. One method, which was previously used to quantify carbonyls with ELISA [2], is to create a calibration standard oxidized protein with carbonyl content determined using the 2,4-DNPH assay [3]. Then, compare the arbitrary-units-number of the other assay (e.g. the FTC assay) with the results of the DNPH assay. The FTC assay [1] is a gel-based assay that fluorescently labels protein carbonyls and then separates the proteins by SDS-PAGE. The fluorescence corresponds to the amount of labeled carbonyls. As you may imagine, the labeling efficiency and fluorescence signal (photobleaching, etc.) varies from run-to-run, so I hope to have fluorescence standards on each gel as well. Having more protein standards than BSA would reduce the number of lanes required for a fluorescence standard. Candidate proteins: GAPDH, creatine kinase, IgG, ???

Biochemistry,"I did a lab this week where we inactivated glutamate dehydrogenase by modifying its lysines with TNBS. The goal was to generate the pseudo-first order rate constant at one large [TNBS] by assaying GDH activity at regular intervals.

Pseudo first order reaction is GDH --k obs--&gt; GDH(inactivated). k obs is the pseudo-first order rate constant.

In our experiment the GDH activity decayed exponentially with time and we used non-linear regression to fit an exponential curve to the data to generate k obs in activity/min becuase the plot was activity vs minutes so the equation would be activity=(b)(e)^[activity/min][min]. I also took the natural log of both sides to generate ln activity vs. time to linearize the curve for linear regression and got the same k obs from the line's equation ln activity=(activity/min)(min)+ln(b).

The problem I have is that I'm trying to compare my values to the literature (ideally to an experiment that used a similar [TNBS] to inactivate GDH), but it appears as though when other people do it their [activity decays linearly in the first place!](http://scialert.net/fulltext/?doi=ajb.2008.320.329#f2) While I don't really trust that publisher, it's the only paper I can find w/ TNBS/GDH, and all other papers I'm finding on TNBS inactivation show linear decay.

-Are the jobs high pressure? Grad school is pretty high-pressure, and postdocs seem to have it worse. The industry folks always seem to be pretty content with their 8a-5p schedule.

-Do you recommend a postdoc before getting a government job?

-Are the people who you work with generally happy? My coworkers have a low morale problem and it isn't fun to be around them at all.

Hello everybody,

I am posting here today somewhat out of frustration but also in an attempt to receive genuine advice and life direction.  First, here is some basic information about myself:

-I have always loved science, math, and physics.  My absolute best memory of college classes was fiddling around with the chromatography equipment and figuring out how to separate analytes in chemical separations.  We had to determine the 8-hydroxyquinoline content in commercial bag balm for one of our labs.  Our prof didn't give any instructions so instead it was a puzzle that I had to work on and eventually successfully solve.

-I graduated from a state university this past April with my undergraduate in Biochemistry and minor in Biology.  

-Originally my plan was to become a dentist.  This was something I was talked into by a family member.  I lost interest about 3 years into my biochem degree.

-I have exemplary work experience at a company that has nothing to do with biochemistry.  They wanted me to come back for a more permanent position but I declined in order to begin my career as a chemist.

So, now, here I am a few months after graduation.  My parents live in North Dakota and so do I for the time being.  As far as biotech industry... well let's just say this area is not ideal.  I have been applying steadily for lab assistant and entry level chemist jobs through Monster, Aerotek, Kelly, and several other major scientific recruiting firms.  I have had a few recruiters call me and have a brief phone interview, but nothing seems to come of it.

Now that I have finished complaining (sorry lol) let me ask for some help and advice:

-I am going in for a second interview with a company that produces huge quantities of fertilizer and ships it on rail cars.  This would be a very physical job with zero laboratory involvement.  The hours are extreme (60+ hours / week) but the pay is good.  Would anyone recommend that I take this job?  I want to focus on my career so I am not sure if this kind of job really helps me in that regard.

-The job sites have so many jobs in areas like NJ, California, and Texas.  If I move to these areas will it significantly improve my chances of being hired for a entry level chemist position?  Most of the recruiters who contact me are located in these areas.  I am worried that they do not take me seriously as a candidate since I live so far away.

I hope you were able to take the time to read and consider my woes.  At this point some guidance will be crucial to determining the next few years of my life and career.  Should I take the job?  Should I say screw it I'm moving to Cali/NJ?  Thanks a bunch!

Biochemistry,"Hey /Biochemistry/, I'm about to be a senior in high school and I'm interested in a couple different career paths. For a while I wanted to be a naturalist of some sort, but I took a class for it and it didn't really interest me since we hardly learned any actual biology, we just sampled stuff from the woods pretty much. And lately I've been kind of looking into the field of biochemistry, because it sounds like it'd be pretty cool to spend time learning about cells and proteins and stuff, and then taking that information and turning it into medicine. If I went into biochemistry I'd probably want to go into medicine. My brother's been trying to get me to go for another possible option of being a vet, which I was considering for a while. He's worried that a job as a biochemist would end up being boring, and that I'd have more fun as a vet, he's training to be a nurse. But I've never been that comfortable with injections and surgeries and whatnot. I want to help with medicine, but not directly. Another thing to add though, I've actually done better in my English classes than my science classes in general. I took honors bio in freshmen year and passed with a b, same with honors chemistry in sophomore year which was even harder. I usually get a b in English too but only because I turned work in late pretty frequently. But I don't want to go into English because it seems like a low-paying area with a lot of competition. Maybe it's because I took those classes one or two years ago, I might do better at them now. But I also prefer science because it's so concrete, the perfect English paper is rather subjective, there isn't too much subjectivity in science. Schooling for biochemistry also seems like it'd be more affordable, I know vet schools means quite a bit of debt, and it's also quite a few more years.

Biochemistry,"I am approaching my senior year of undergrad, finishing up a BA in biochemistry. When I started college I thought I wanted to go into academic research and teaching, but after several experiences with undergrad research, there is no way I can spend my whole life in the academy. I love chemistry and biochemistry, I just don't think that I want my career to be the center of my life the way that it is for academic researchers. I also do not want to be reduced to a grant writing machine begging for money. The idea of industry research appeals to me but to my knowledge you also need a PhD to do very well in that realm.

Currently I have an internship in an academic biochem/organic chem lab, and generally I like it. But the thought of spending another 6 years in the academic world getting a PhD makes me sorta sick. Especially considering that job prospects for both academic and industry scientists are not great: the market is hard no matter what, very little security, NO guarantees. I might be able to push through the degree after taking some time off after undergrad, maybe working in industry to prove to myself that that's what I really want to do. But if the idea of grad school bums me out already, I will definitely not want to go back after having made semi-decent money for a while. 

I am probably writing this primarily to vent: First, I am disappointed in myself. I am saddened because I set out to do this thing (become a researcher) a long time ago and it probably won't happen after all, even though it is probably for the best, since I have learned that its not what I want. I also feel that I have been mislead about science careers by my mentors and superiors all along. I thought that as long as I got a PhD I would be totally set with a career and a good salary. Now that I know this isn't true (from talking to the current grad students that I work with) I am considering other options. What else can I do with my BA in biochemistry, other than grad school leading to a PhD and research? I am pretty sure that generally the master's in biochem is regarded as a throwaway PhD anyway (also, not paid for?), so I am not really considering that. Other fields to go into/career possibilities, anyone?

I've gladly helped others throughout the years but I figured having that official experience would look good on a future resume.  I've always aspired towards becoming an MD but as of late I've had my doubts if this is the right path for me (ha, cute rhyme).  I hear about kids becoming suicidal, overwhelmed in debt, and generally depressed during and even after they've completed medical school.  I've been considering the military route, one in which a majority (if not all) my medical school expenses will be paid for upon enlistment but again, all I hear are horror stories about people filled with regret, preaching onto others to not make their mistake.

I'm currently interested in studying the efficiency of luciferase and its interaction with another fluorescent nanoparticle in solution. To derive meaningful interpretations, my PI asked me to assess the efficiency of the individual components first (ie, photons/second/luciferase). The impression I get from papers and coworkers is a luminometer setup with a 96-well plate would be ideal, and perhaps the most convincing way would be to vary substrate concentrations (or dilute enzyme significantly) to derive Michaelis-Menten parameters, and account for both depletion of light output over time and extrapolate a curve to single luciferase efficiency. I found surprisingly few papers on this, although it may be too simple without experimental context to search for.

I am using Sigma-purchased firefly luciferase and its substrate, D-luciferin, which emits yellow-green (roughly 525-625).

Biochemistry,"Thyroid hormone (T4,T3) is apparently the sole iodine-dependent molecule in the body, and an elaborate system exists to support it. It is found in all animals (don't know about lower eukaryotes). 

What do the iodine moieties contribute that no other structure could achieve? Why couldn't it have been a steroid hormone? Steroid hormones function similarly, with DNA-binding receptors in the nucleus and mitochondria, as well as nongenomic rapid-acting effects. 

It appears that no one has figured out the mechanism of thyroid hormone's direct effects on the mitochondria (e.g. uncoupling). Binding sites for T3 exist in the mitochondria. Could the answer lie here? Maybe thyroxine becomes deionized in the low mitochondrial pH and has some direct interaction?

Biochemistry,"Hi everyone,

I'm looking for an essential (ie knockout would lower growth) peroxisomal enzyme in human or mouse liver cell lines (eg HepG2, or 393 cells if it's a better system) that could be developed into a fusion protein with an enzyme of interest as a stability assay.

I read a paper where a several mutations of an enzyme of interest were inserted into the middle of DHFR (an essential enzyme) and express in yeast cells that were DHFR(-), and the idea was that growth of the yeast cells relative to wild type or non-fused DHFR would be an in vivo measurement of protein stability, since instability would be poorly favored for survival.

I would very much like to build on this by creating a fusion with a peroxisomal enzyme (since my enzyme of interest is peroxisomal) and express it in mammalian cells, liver if possible. I'm looking up peroxisomal pathways and fusions but haven't had any luck.

Side note: It took me a while to realize that yeast cells in a petri dish = in vivo, but human hepatocyte cells in a dish = in vitro, since it's outside of the organism.

Biochemistry,"Hi everyone,

I am a graduate student proposing a research project as part of my qualifying exam, and my topic is alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT), a liver peroxisomal enzyme that detoxifies glyoxylate to glycine in normal metabolism. Certain mutations along with higher risk alleles for this enzyme can result in accidental trafficking into the mitochondria, stability issues, activity issues, and all sorts of unproductive outcomes resulting in unmetabolized glyoxylate progressing into kidney stone disorders and potentially renal damage. I am currently looking for ways to propose characterizing this process, since most work done so far seems to be solving structures and looking at activity in different mutants. I am searching through papers for uncharacterized aspects of the system, but figured I would ask you all since I am often surprised by your insight and suggestions, and I am allowed and encouraged to seek outside help.

This project is designed to deviate from our normal fields of study, and thus I find myself getting familiar with more classic approaches to study cell biology and metabolism, but not something particularly novel.

Biochemistry,"Hey all!  
  
For those of us still in school, finals are likely right around the corner. I wanted to take this opportunity to remind everyone here of two things:  
  
1. If you ask a question and someone provides you with a helpful and thorough response, please respond back to them. This accomplishes two things ‚Äì at the very least, this lets the person know that you indeed checked their response. More importantly, it will make responders more likely to help others in the future. If a member of this subreddit provides a good response for you, a simple ""thank you"" or ""ok that helped"" will go a long way. It will make that person more likely in the future to offer help to others, and this is great for a community such as ours, where a large portion of the posts are questions about coursework and biochemical theories/processes. In short ‚Äì if someone helps, say ""thank you""! They'll be more likely in the future to help you again.  
  
2. Do not be afraid to ask questions! We have a stickied post called ""Homework Mega Thread"" where you can ask specific questions from your homework, exams, etc. For more general questions about theories and whatnot, a separate post is fine.  
  
Good luck with the rest of the semester!
