       "Hi, Iâ€™m a junior and I took AP Bio my sophomore year. I really liked this class. I did really well and would want to help incoming AP Bio students learn it easily. I can help you prepare throughout the summer and during the school year to get that 5 on the AP Bio exam. You can respond to me or comment if you want me to make another class to help you learn other topics in biology, such as skeletal system/neuroscience/muscular systems/anything you would be interested in. Iâ€™ll post videos, worksheets, quizzes/exercises that you can do if you would like, and we can even meet on zoom if you guys would want.

       "So, I was reheating ground beef and realized that the beef at the bottom of the container (that was still wet) was all covered in bacteria. The meat at the top of the container that was not touching it at all looks completely fine. \\n\\nI have never cooked beef before and would like to know anyone's opinion on this because i don't want to throw out my dish if i can avoid it. Sorry if this the wrong sub to post.

       "\\nHey guys, just looking for some advice. Currently, Iâ€™m a sophomore bio major w/ a plant and soil science minor. Iâ€™m mainly interested in pursuing a career related to plant science, agronomy, etc or soil conservation but Iâ€™m not closed off to other opportunities that may arise. Would it be beneficial to add an environmental science minor career wise? Iâ€™m really interested in the classes that satisfy that minor at my uni and extra time or money isnâ€™t really a factor. Any thoughts, anecdotes, pros/cons welcome.\\n\\nThanks in advance :)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  1\n",

       "I didn't realize how significant knowledge of immunology is and didn't even think to take a course until  half way through my final quarter of college. I have decide to try to learn on my own since I have entirely too much free time and think it would be really helpful. Anyway, does anyone know a good lecture series on this? I looked a bit, but decided it make more sense to ask before digging through videos for hours. Any info is helpful.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   1\n",

       "It's fun to hear what everyone is passionate about. If a favorite small molecule does't come to mind then try to think of a structural motif or enzymatic mechanism that tickles your fancy. \\n\\nMy answer: I love all of the crazy implications different RNA tertiary structures can have on biological functions. I am biased because I work with telomerase, which has a badass RNA component called TR. TR acts as both a template for the reverse transcriptase component of the telomerase enzyme andddd as an important structural feature of the holoenzyme. But, I am also extremely intrigued by the translational regulation that IRES's (internal ribosome entry sites) seem to accomplish. I am excited to see how we can learn from IRES's and maybe use them in order to promote the expression of \"good\" proteins for therapeutic use.\\n\\nYour turn!       1\n",

       "So I've been writing a lot of undergrad research papers on this topic and my conclusion is that there's maybe not actually that much use for metabolomics assisted selection. I've been arguing for it for months with points like cost and secondary metabolite selection and what not, but it just seems useless when compared to genomics selection. Does anyone have any reason/ scenario in which metabolomics assisted selection is better than gene assisted selection?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              1\n",
